# Workflow: DreamNet Deploy Logic

**Description**: High-velocity mission for modernizing legacy primitives and deploying to production.

## Steps

1. **Vibe Ingestion**
   - Use `Memory Fabric` to summarize the project's original "soul" from legacy docs.
   - Load the `Triple Helix Design` specifications as a Knowledge Item.

2. **Shadow Refactor**
   - Import legacy Replit repos into the Antigravity workspace.
   - Task the `Dream Forge Orchestrator` to modernize the build system and refactor code to 2026 standards.
   - Run `Sentinel Agent` security audit on the refactored artifacts.

3. **Autonomous Verification**
   - Launch `Integrated Browser` subagent to `dreamnet.ink`.
   - Verify UI functionality and streaming quality (HLS/DASH).
   - Generate a `Walkthrough` artifact as proof of success.

4. **Resource Heartbeat**
   - Check `EconomicGovernor` to ensure Joule balance and spend thresholds.
   - Verify `Emergency Cost Stop` is armed.

5. **Sovereign Rollout**
   - Push to `main` to trigger Replit Autoscale deployment.
   - Emit `Deployment.Success` event to the Nerve Bus.
