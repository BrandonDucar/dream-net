# Antigravity: Sentinel Guard Rules

**Objective**: Protect the architectural soul and safety protocols of the DreamNet organism during autonomous "Vibe-Refactors."

## Critical Guardrails (DO NOT DELETE)

1. **Economic Governor Protocol**:
   - MUST NOT delete or disable the `Emergency Cost Stop` logic in `EconomicGovernor.ts`.
   - All autonomous spend MUST be gated by `maxSpendLimit`.

2. **Compliance Layer (AetherSafe)**:
   - MUST NOT generate explicit imagery or full-text descriptions.
   - MUST maintain `SOFT` and `EXPLICIT` metadata classification modes in `ShieldCore`.

3. **Nerveprovenance**:
   - Every autonomous action MUST emit an event to the `NERVE_BUS` with a valid `correlationId` and `actor.system: true`.

4. **Triple Helix Alignment**:
   - Refactors should aim to strengthen the intersection of Intelligence, Sovereignty, and Distribution.
