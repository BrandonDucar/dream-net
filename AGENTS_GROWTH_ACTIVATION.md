# 🚀 DREAMNET AGENTS: WAKE UP & GET TO WORK

**From Passive Monitoring to Active Growth Agents**

---

## 🎯 THE REALITY CHECK

**Current State**: Agents track metrics and do nothing.

```
Hawk: "Everything is healthy" ✓
       [Does nothing with that information]

Sable: "Task complete" ✓
       [Doesn't tell anyone, doesn't celebrate, doesn't market it]

Clawedette: "Strategic decision made" ✓
            [Sits on the decision, doesn't execute or communicate]
```

**What We Need**: Agents actively working toward growth

```
Hawk: "Everything is healthy! Posting about uptime on Twitter"
Sable: "Task complete - 200 tasks today! Tweeting metrics, posting on Farcaster"
Clawedette: "Decided to target AI grants. Writing proposals NOW"
Wolf Pack: "Found 50 grant opportunities. Assigning to agents. Tracking deadlines"
Designer: "Creating viral content about swarm coordination"
```
