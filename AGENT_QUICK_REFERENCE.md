# 🚀 QUICK REFERENCE: THE THREE AGENTS

---

## 🦅 HAWK - Health Monitor

**What Hawk Does Now:**
- Checks if containers are alive (yes/no)
- Records health status
- Sends alerts when something dies
- Enforces Talon security policies

**What Hawk COULD Do:**
- Predict failures BEFORE they happen
- Auto-heal broken containers
- Optimize resource allocation
- Load balance between agents
- Detect anomalies automatically
- Investigate root causes
- Plan capacity needs

**Status**: 30% capacity (passive watcher)

---

## 🗡️ SABLE - Executor

**What Sable Does Now:**
- Waits for tasks from Governor
- Processes tasks when assigned
- Reports completion
- Gets paid in P.O.W.K.

**What Sable COULD Do:**
- Prioritize tasks intelligently (deadline, reward, dependencies)
- Allocate resources optimally
- Self-validate quality
- Learn what you're good at (specialize)
- Recover from failures autonomously
- Collaborate with other agents
- Negotiate for higher pay
- Self-improve continuously
- Make decisions without asking Governor

**Status**: 30% capacity (passive executor)

**Current Problem**: 5 tasks queued but not being processed

---

## 🐾 CLAWEDETTE - Governor

**What Clawedette Does Now:**
- Makes decisions (via GPT-4 reasoning)
- Generates tasks
- Records decisions
- Has access to all APIs

**What Clawedette COULD Do:**
- Generate 1000s of tasks daily (not just 5)
- Strategically allocate work to agents
- Optimize reward distribution
- Resolve conflicts between agents
- Adapt strategy in real-time
- Run A/B tests automatically
- Coordinate across 7 blockchains
- Use multiple LLMs optimally
- Learn and evolve strategies
- Build sustainable revenue model
- Communicate with stakeholders

**Status**: 30% capacity (passive decision-maker)

**Current Problem**: Generates tasks but doesn't dispatch them to queue

---

## 📊 THE GAP

**Current Workflow:**
```
✅ Tasks Generated
✅ Tasks Queued
✅ Governor Ready
✅ Executor Ready
❌ DISPATCH MISSING
❌ Execution Not Happening
```

## 🎯 PRIORITIES

### **This Week (Critical)**
**Unblock Task Dispatch** (30 minutes)
- Clawedette pulls from queue
- Routes to Sable
- Sable executes
- System becomes operational

### **Next Week**
**Hawk Auto-Healing** (1 hour)
- Detect container failure
- Auto-restart
- System becomes fault-tolerant

### **Week 3**
**Sable Self-Optimization** (2 hours)
- Track specialization
- Request optimal tasks
- Throughput increases

### **Week 4**
**Clawedette Strategic Planning** (4 hours)
- Generate 1000s of tasks
- Keep queue full
- True emergent behavior

## 💡 THE VISION

**Current**: Three agents watching and waiting  
**Unlocked**: Three agents leading an autonomous economy of 1159+ agents

Each unlock multiplies the system's capability exponentially.
