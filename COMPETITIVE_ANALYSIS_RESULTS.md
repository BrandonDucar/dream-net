# Competitive Intelligence Analysis Results

## Direct Analysis - Running Now

I'm analyzing all companies directly using the Competitive Intelligence Core. Here's what I'm doing:

1. **Loading all 68 companies** across 13 verticals
2. **Analyzing each company** to identify:
   - Features they have
   - Features they're missing (DreamNet opportunities)
   - Technology stack gaps
   - Market opportunities
3. **Finding opportunities** by vertical
4. **Generating innovation roadmaps** with prioritized features

## Analysis in Progress...

Let me run this directly and show you the results.
