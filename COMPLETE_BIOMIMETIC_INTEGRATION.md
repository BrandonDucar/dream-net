## 🔗 Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Systems (Do First)

#### 1. Star Bridge Lungs → Super Brain
**What:** Hook cross-chain monitoring to Brain
**Why:** Brain needs chain health for decisions
**How:**
- Star Bridge events → Super Brain event queue
- Chain health metrics → Brain context
- Cross-chain opportunities → Drive Engine (Wolf Pack)

#### 2. Neural Mesh → Super Brain
**What:** Hook synaptic connections to Brain
**Why:** Brain needs memory and pattern recognition
**How:**
- Neural Mesh events → Super Brain
- Memory traces → Brain Store
- Pattern recognition → Decision Engine

#### 3. Halo-Loop → Super Brain
**What:** Hook self-healing to Brain
**Why:** Brain needs system health awareness
**How:**
- Halo-Loop cycles → Super Brain events
- Health issues → Brain decisions
- Repair actions → Action Executor

#### 4. Shield Core → Super Brain
**What:** Hook immune system to Brain
**Why:** Brain needs threat awareness
**How:**
- Shield events → Super Brain
- Threat detection → Brain decisions
- Defense actions → Action Executor

### Phase 2: Memory & Learning

#### 5. Dream Snail → Super Brain
**What:** Hook privacy trails to Brain
**Why:** Brain needs privacy-aware decisions
**How:**
- Privacy events → Super Brain
- Trail data → Brain Store (privacy-respecting)

#### 6. Slug-Time Memory → Super Brain
**What:** Hook temporal memory to Brain
**Why:** Brain needs time-aware context
**How:**
- Memory snapshots → Brain Store
- Temporal patterns → Decision Engine

### Phase 3: Advanced Systems

#### 7. Predator-Scavenger Loop → Super Brain
**What:** Hook metabolic cleanup to Brain
**Why:** Brain needs resource management
**How:**
- Cleanup events → Super Brain
- Resource decisions → Decision Engine

#### 8. Dream Cortex → Super Brain
**What:** Hook decision making to Brain
**Why:** Brain can learn from Cortex decisions
**How:**
- Cortex decisions → Brain Store
- Pattern learning → Decision Engine

### Phase 4: Mini-Apps Integration

#### 9. Mini-Apps → Super Brain
**What:** Hook all 50+ mini-apps to Brain
**Why:** Brain needs to know what apps are doing
**How:**
- Mini-app events → Super Brain
- App usage → Brain Store
- App recommendations → Decision Engine
