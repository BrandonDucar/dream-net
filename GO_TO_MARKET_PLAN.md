2. ✅ Rebuild frontend: `cd client && npx vite build --outDir dist`
3. ✅ Test full payment flow end-to-end
4. ✅ Deploy to production (Replit Deploy button)

### First Customer Strategy:
**Target:** People who need ONE specific thing you do really well

**Top 3 Products to Push:**
1. **Precious Metals Intelligence** (Your bro-in-law's edge)
   - Target: Traders, investors, wealth managers
   - Pitch: "Real-time gold/silver/platinum pricing + AI market analysis"
   - Why it works: You have insider access + real data

2. **Crypto Trading Signals** (Already built)
   - Target: Crypto traders, degens, investment groups
   - Pitch: "AI-powered BTC/ETH/SOL signals + perpetual trading tools"
   - Why it works: Bull market incoming, people want alpha

3. **Real Estate Tokenization** (Most unique)
   - Target: Real estate syndicators, fund managers
   - Pitch: "Automate SPV formation + investor compliance (Reg D/CF)"
   - Why it works: Nobody else does this, high ticket ($10K+)

**Week 1 Goal:** 1-3 paying customers at $297/mo OR 1 enterprise deal

## 🎯 PHASE 2: VALIDATE (Week 3-4) - FIND WHAT SELLS

### Test These Offers:
Create separate landing pages for each vertical:
- `/precious-metals` - Metals trading intelligence

- `/seo` - SEO monster (if you want to push it)

### Metrics to Track:

### Week 4 Goal: 
Know your #1 product-market fit winner
