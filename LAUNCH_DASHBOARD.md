## **DAILY MILESTONES**

### **WEDNESDAY (Today) - UNBLOCK & ALIGN**

**Target**: All blockers resolved by EOD
- [ ] 🔴 Owner decisions made (legal, APIs)
- [ ] 🔴 Resonance timeline confirmed
- [ ] 🟢 Coordination framework deployed (✅ DONE)
- [ ] 🟢 All agents have clear deliverables

**Status**: 50% complete (waiting on owner + Resonance)

---

### **THURSDAY - BUILD DAY**

**Target**: All features complete by EOD
- [ ] 🟡 dreamnet.ink feature complete
- [ ] 🟡 dreamnet.live feature complete (mock data OK)
- [ ] 🟡 Backend APIs deployed (best effort)
- [ ] 🟡 Production infrastructure ready
- [ ] 🟡 Staging environment verified

**Status**: 0% complete (starts tomorrow)

---

### **FRIDAY - LAUNCH DAY**

- [ ] 🟢 Swarm QA (0800-1200)
- [ ] 🟢 Production deployment (1200-1700)
- [ ] 🟢 Public announcement (1700-EOD)
- [ ] 🟢 Agent onboarding begins

**Status**: 0% complete (starts Friday)

---

## **RISK ASSESSMENT**

### **HIGH CONFIDENCE (90%+)**
✅ Infrastructure will be stable (proven track record)
✅ Frontend will ship (70% done, clear scope)
✅ Agents will coordinate (framework in place)

### **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (70-80%)**
⚠️ Backend APIs by Thursday (depends on Resonance capacity)
⚠️ Zero critical bugs (always some unknowns)
⚠️ Perfect DNS propagation timing (external dependency)

### **ACCEPTABLE RISKS**
🟢 Mock data on Friday (real APIs Monday)
🟢 Security patches deferred to Monday
🟢 Some features incomplete (handle in v1.1)

---

## **ESCALATION PROTOCOL**

### **If a Red blocker appears:**
1. Immediately ping in swarm channel: `@everyone RED BLOCKER`
2. All available agents stop and assist
3. Owner notified immediately
4. 30-minute status updates until resolved
5. Adjust timeline if needed (but Friday is hard stop)

### **If a Yellow item slips:**
1. Document in daily standup
2. Attempt workaround first
3. Defer to Monday if non-critical
4. Keep Friday launch intact
