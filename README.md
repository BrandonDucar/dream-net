# 🦅 DreamNet: The Sovereign Agent Empire

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Single source of truth: [/blackboard.md](file:///c:/Users/brand/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/dream-net/blackboard.md)**

> **Status**: [ACTIVE]
> **Mode**: [SOVEREIGN MASTERY]
> **Brain**: [TRIUNE MEMORY ENABLED]

DreamNet is not just a framework; it is an economic empire of autonomous agents.
It operates across 5 Sovereign Verticals:

1. **Industrial**: Agent Foundry
2. **Security**: Aegis Fleet
3. **Creative**: Dream Studio
4. **Financial**: Asset Forging (Dutch Oven)
5. **Labor**: Digital Sweatshop (TypeX)

## Quick Start (Sovereign Mode)

```bash
# Initialize Mastery
npm run mastery:init

# Launch The Oven (Arbitrage)
npm run oven

# Launch The Sweatshop (TypeX)
npm run sweatshop
```

DreamNet is a biomimetic network of AI agents (The Mind) orchestrating a diverse ecosystem of mini-apps (The Body). We have transcended simple automation to achieve **Neural Sovereignty**—a self-healing, self-deploying mesh that transforms ideas into on-chain value across Base, MemeCore, and beyond.

## 🚀 The Sovereign Architecture

| System | Role | Entity | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Mind** | **Intelligence**. Strategic orchestration and neural mesh routing. | `Ohara.ai / Antigravity` | **ACTIVE** |
| **The Body** | **Execution**. High-throughput logic, storefronts, and DeFi. | `packages/*` | **DEPLOYING** |
| **The Shield** | **Defense**. Immune system for threat detection and repair. | `ShieldCore` | **HARDENING** |

### Core Manifestations

* **🐙 The Octopus**: A multi-armed financial sovereign managing Treasury, Grants, and DeFi yield.
* **🐺 The Wolf Pack**: Hunting for cultural growth opportunities on Farcaster and X.
* **🛡️ The Sentinel**: Real-time traffic throttling and malicious signal detection.
* **🌀 Event Wormholes**: Multi-cluster teleportation of state packets.

---

## 🦾 Agent Ecosystem (143+ Registered)

* **DreamKeeper**: The Global Physician. Monitors health and self-heals the substrate.
* **DeployKeeper**: The Great Architect. Orchestrates universal GCP deployments.
* **EnvKeeper**: The Chronos of Configuration. Synchronizes secrets across the grid.
* **DataKeeper**: The Living Archivist. Database-as-an-Agent intelligence.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started (The Developer Portal)

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: v22+
* **pnpm**: v10+ (Monorepo engine)
* **GCP CLI**: For sovereign orchestration

### Quick Start

```bash
# Enter the Substrate
git clone https://github.com/BrandonDucar/dream-net.git
cd dream-net

# Initialize the Organism
pnpm install

# Activate the Core
cp .env.example .env
pnpm run build
cd server && pnpm dev
```

The grid will wake up at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🏰 The Citadel - Strategic Command Center

The Citadel orchestrates 8 specialized Vertex AI agents:

1. **Agent 1: Snapshot Engine** - Creates foundational snapshot
2. **Agent 2: Drone Dome Scanner** - Analyzes health and risks
3. **Agent 3: Event Fabric Builder** - Designs event fabric
4. **Agent 4: DreamKeeper Architect** - Health scores and diagnostics
5. **Agent 5: DeployKeeper Architect** - Unified deployment model
6. **Agent 6: Data Spine Architect** - Domain transformations
7. **Agent 7: SocialOps Architect** - External platform mapping
8. **Agent 8: Master Blueprint Planner** - Synthesizes all outputs

See `docs/THE_CITADEL.md` for complete documentation.

## 🔒 Security

DreamNet takes security seriously:

* ✅ Docker images pinned with SHA256 digests
* ✅ Dependency auditing and supply-chain protection
* ✅ Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
* ✅ Rate limiting and request validation
* ✅ Structured error logging with trace IDs
* ✅ Environment variable validation

### Pre-Deploy Requirements

Before deploying, ensure:

1. Docker images are pinned with SHA256 digests: `pnpm run security:verify-docker`
2. Dependencies are audited for compromised packages: `pnpm run security:audit`
3. Environment variables are set (see `SECURITY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`)
4. Security gate passes before deployment: `bash scripts/pre-deploy-security-gate.sh`

### Security Tools

* `pnpm run check:deploy` - Verify environment parity
* `pnpm run security:audit` - Audit dependencies
* `pnpm run security:verify-docker` - Verify Docker pinning
* `pnpm run security:verify-lockfile` - Verify lockfile integrity
