# 🛡️ Project Safety & Ethical Manifest

## Mission Statement

DreamNet is an advanced research project focused on **Agentic Autonomy**, **Sovereign Identity**, and **Decentralized Infrastructure**. Our goal is to provide a robust technical substrate for the evolution of autonomous digital citizens.

## Ethical Boundaries

1. **No Malicious Intent**: The system is designed for educational and experimental purposes. It does not contain code for unauthorized access, data theft, or malicious disruption of services.
2. **Sovereignty First**: We prioritize user and agent sovereignty. Every action is recorded and auditable via the Internal Nerve Bus.
3. **Safety Filters**: We implement Constitutional Guardrails (e.g., `ConstitutionalGuard.ts`) that utilize Constitutional AI principles to veto harmful intents.
4. **Research Substrate**: Terms like "Strategic Agent" (fka Mercenary) and "Resonance" (fka Hijack) refer to the competitive optimization of AI models and resource allocation, not physical or cyber warfare.

## Auditability

All internal states are tracked via:

- **Vector Mesh**: Long-term memory storage.
- **Nerve Bus**: Real-time event telemetry.
- **Durable Logging**: Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) for all economic transactions.
