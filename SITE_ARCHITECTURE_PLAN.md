## 🧠 NAVIGATION STRATEGY:

### **Landing Page (/)** 
**Goal:** Funnel to ONE action: Subscribe or Contact Sales
- Hero with clear value prop
- Pricing tiers (3 cards)
- CTA buttons
- Footer links only

### **Products Hub (/products)**
**NEW** - Single page listing all verticals
- Grid of product cards
- Click → Dedicated landing page for that product
- Each product has: Description, Features, Pricing, CTA

### **Platform (/platform)**
**After Login** - Main app interface
- Top nav: Mesh | Feed | Mycelium | Analytics | Settings
- Sidebar: Agent status, quick actions
- Footer: Docs, Support, Logout

---

## 🎨 COMPONENT REUSE (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)

### Shared Components:
```
/components
├── Header.jsx           → Reusable header
├── Footer.jsx           → Reusable footer
├── PricingCard.jsx      → Pricing tier card
├── ProductCard.jsx      → Product feature card
├── CTAButton.jsx        → Call-to-action button
├── AgentStatus.jsx      → Agent health indicator
└── NetworkGraph.jsx     → Mycelium/mesh visualization
```

**No duplication = Easier to update**
