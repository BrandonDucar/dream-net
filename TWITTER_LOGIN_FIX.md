# 🔧 Fix X Login Issue (Passkey Not Working)

## The Problem

X migrated from `twitter.com` to `x.com`, and **passkeys registered on twitter.com don't work on x.com anymore**.

## ✅ Quick Fixes (Try These First)

### Option 1: Use Recovery Key
1. On login page, look for **"Use recovery key"** or **"Having trouble?"**
2. Click it
3. Enter your recovery key (saved when you set up 2FA)
4. This should let you in!

### Option 2: Use Password Instead
1. On login page, look for **"Use password"** or **"Sign in with password"**
2. Enter your username/email + password
3. Skip the passkey prompt

### Option 3: Disable Passkey Temporarily
If you can get in somehow:
1. Go to **Settings & Privacy** → **Security and Account Access** → **Security**
2. Go to **Two-factor authentication**
3. **Uncheck "Security Key"**
4. Save with your password
5. Now you can log in with just password!

## 🚀 Alternative: Start with Other Platforms

**While we fix Twitter, let's get these working:**

### Instagram (Easier!)
- Uses Facebook Developer Portal
- Usually easier login
- Same API for Instagram + Facebook

### LinkedIn
- Separate developer portal
- Usually no passkey issues

### TikTok
- Own developer portal
- Separate login system

**I can help you set these up RIGHT NOW while we figure out Twitter!**
