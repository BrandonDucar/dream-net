# ✅ Twitter Login Solutions (Passkey Issue)

## 🎯 I Found 3 Easy Ways to Log In!

The login page has these options:

- Use your Google account
- No passkey needed!

### Option 2: Sign in with Apple
- Click **"Sign in with Apple"** button
- Use your Apple ID

### Option 3: Username + Password
1. Enter your **phone, email, or username** in the textbox
2. Click **"Next"**
3. It should ask for **password** (not passkey!)
4. Enter password and log in

## 💡 Alternative: Set Up Other Platforms First

**While we fix Twitter, let's get these working:**

### Instagram (Easier!)
- Uses Facebook Developer Portal
- Usually easier login
- Same API for Instagram + Facebook

### LinkedIn
- Separate developer portal
- Usually no passkey issues

### TikTok
- Own developer portal
- Separate login system

**I can help you set these up RIGHT NOW!**
