# X/Twitter Account Suspension - Resolution Guide

## Current Status
- **Account Email:** Bduke9in@gmail.com
- **Status:** Account suspended - cannot access developer portal

## Options to Resolve

### Option 1: Appeal the Suspension (Recommended)

2. **Select:** "Account access" → "Appeal an account suspension"
3. **Fill out the form** explaining:
   - Why you need developer access
   - What you're building (DreamNet social media automation)
   - That you'll comply with X's API terms
4. **Wait for response** (usually 24-48 hours)

### Option 2: Use a Different X Account
1. **Create a new X account** with a different email
2. **Verify the account** (phone/email verification)
3. **Wait 24-48 hours** for account to be fully active

### Option 3: Skip X for Now
