  "abstract": "Modern AI systems increasingly resemble complex ecosystems: many models, tools, agents, datasets, and services interact over time, producing behavior that is emergent, nonlinear, and difficult to predict. However, most AI infrastructure is still designed and governed as if it were static software. In this paper we introduce DreamNet, a self-evolving multi-agent ecosystem explicitly aligned with principles from complex systems science, swarm intelligence, and adaptive governance. DreamNet combines a central orchestration core (the Citadel) with a layered defense and monitoring structure (the Dome), a family of specialized agents (for deployment, diagnostics, messaging, and creation), and a stigmergic logging fabric that allows agents to coordinate indirectly over time. The result is an AI infrastructure that functions less like a single model or pipeline and more like a living digital organism: capable of self-monitoring, self-improvement, and controlled evolution under human oversight. We describe the architecture, governance patterns, and implementation details, and we outline concrete use cases in infrastructure automation, Web3 ecosystems, social funnels, and creative tooling.",
