### Staked Coin Liquidity Pool System (IMPLEMENTING)

**Status:** 🔄 **IMPLEMENTING** - Aerodrome gauge staking system

**Aerodrome Integration (`packages/liquidity-core/src/AerodromeClient.ts`):**
- **Gauge Staking**: `stakeInGauge(gaugeAddress, lpTokenAmount)` - Stake LP tokens in Aerodrome gauges
- **Liquidity Addition**: `addLiquidity(poolAddress, amount0, amount1)` - Add liquidity to Aerodrome pools
- **Epoch Management**: Weekly epoch cutoff (Wednesday 23:00 UTC)
  - `isEpochCutoffApproaching()` - Checks if within 24 hours of cutoff
  - `getNextWednesday23UTC()` - Calculates next epoch cutoff timestamp
- **Gauge Info**: `getGaugeEmissionsSchedule(poolAddress)` - Get emissions schedule for pool

**Liquidity Seeder (`packages/liquidity-core/src/LiquiditySeeder.ts`):**
- Orchestrates liquidity seeding across Aerodrome and Uniswap
- Checks epoch cutoff approaching (warns to stake before Weds 23:00 UTC)
- Coordinates multi-DEX liquidity operations
- **Note**: Currently stubbed - "Antigravity will implement gauge staking"

**Liquidity Pool Configurations (`packages/liquidity-engine/`):**
- **DREAM Pairs**: DREAM-AERO (preferred), DREAM-ETH, DREAM-USDT
- **SHEEP Pairs**: SHEEP-AERO (preferred), SHEEP-ETH, SHEEP-USDT
- **Pool States**: planned → deployed → active → deprecated
- **Pool Health**: unknown → thin → healthy → imbalanced
- **DEX Support**: Aerodrome (primary), Uniswap V3, Uniswap V4

**Staking Flow:**
1. User adds liquidity to Aerodrome pool → Receives LP tokens
2. User stakes LP tokens in gauge → Earns emissions rewards

### Staked Liquidity Units (SLU) System - NOVEL INNOVATION

**Status:** 🔄 **IMPLEMENTING** - Revolutionary triple-yield liquidity pools

**Concept**: Staked tokens (stSPK) act as the **base asset** in liquidity pools, creating **Staked Liquidity Units (SLUs)** that earn:
1. **Staking Rewards** (stSPK continues earning while in pool)
2. **Swap Fees** (0.3% per trade)
3. **Emissions** (Gauge staking rewards)

**Pool Pairs**:
- stSPK + DREAM → SLU-DREAM
- stSPK + USDC → SLU-USDC
- stSPK + ETH → SLU-ETH
- stSPK + SOL → SLU-SOL (via Wormhole/Portal bridge)

**Smart Contracts Created**:
- `StakedSPK.sol` - Receipt token for staked SPK (auto-compounding)
- `SLUPool.sol` - Main pool contract accepting stSPK as base asset
- `SLUWrapper.sol` - Compatibility layer for Aerodrome/Uniswap
- `ISLUPool.sol` - Interface definitions

**TypeScript Clients Created**:
- `SLUSystem.ts` - Client for interacting with SLU pools
- `SLUSeeder.ts` - Admin seeding tool (connects to admin wallet with stSPK)
- `SOLBridge.ts` - Cross-chain SOL integration

**DreamNet Super-Charged Features**:
- **Wolf Pack**: Discovers optimal seeding opportunities
- **Drive Engine**: Motivates liquidity operations
- **Super Brain**: Autonomous rebalancing
- **Shield Core**: MEV protection (auto-switch to protected RPCs)
- **Star Bridge Lungs**: Cross-chain monitoring for SOL bridge
- **Neural Mesh**: Pattern learning for optimal LP ratios
- **Economic Engine**: Token flow tracking and reward distribution

**Admin Assets**:
- stSPK in admin wallet (ready for seeding)
- stETH in Coinbase (can bridge to Base as wstETH)

**Why This Is Novel**:
- **First native implementation** where staked tokens are base asset (not receipt token)
- **First triple-yield system** (staking + fees + emissions) in single pool
- **First auto-compounding** staked liquidity pools
- **First to combine** with LVR protection via collateral multipliers

**Benefits**:
- ~10% total yield vs ~2% in traditional LP (5x better)
- Capital efficiency (staked tokens remain productive)
- Reduced IL risk (staking rewards offset impermanent loss)
- Protocol alignment (signals long-term commitment)
- Competitive moat (first-mover advantage)

**Still To Explore (Lower Priority):**

- Full database migrations (detailed schema)
- X402 Payment Gateway micropayment flow details
- Mini-app contract interaction patterns
- Real RPC integration for Star Bridge Lungs (currently stubbed)
- Aerodrome gauge contract implementation (currently stubbed)
- SLU pool contract deployment and testing
- SOL bridge integration (Wormhole/Portal)
