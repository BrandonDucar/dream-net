# DreamNet Documentation

Welcome to the DreamNet documentation. This directory contains comprehensive documentation for all DreamNet subsystems, APIs, and architecture.

## Overview

DreamNet is a biomimetic AI ecosystem with self-healing, self-optimizing, and self-expanding capabilities. It consists of multiple subsystems that work together to create a unified, intelligent system.

## Documentation Structure

### Subsystems
- [Squad Builder](./subsystems/squad-builder.md) - Agent orchestration and task dispatch
- [Event Wormholes](./subsystems/event-wormholes.md) - Event bus and routing
- [Spore Engine](./subsystems/spore-engine.md) - Prompt spore distribution
- [Dark Fabric](./subsystems/dark-fabric.md) - Code generation and testing
- [HALO Loop](./subsystems/halo-loop.md) - System analysis and optimization
- [Graft Engine](./subsystems/graft-engine.md) - System expansion
- [Memory DNA](./subsystems/memory-dna.md) - Persistent memory
- [Resonance Engine](./subsystems/resonance-engine.md) - Cross-entity learning
- [Alive Mode](./subsystems/alive-mode.md) - System health monitoring

### API Documentation
- [API Overview](./api/README.md) - API documentation overview
- Individual API documentation files in `api/` directory

### Architecture
- [Integration Architecture](./architecture/integrations.md) - How subsystems integrate
- [System Architecture](./architecture/system.md) - Overall system architecture

## Quick Start

### For Developers
1. Read [System Architecture](./architecture/system.md) for an overview
2. Read [Integration Architecture](./architecture/integrations.md) to understand how subsystems work together
3. Read individual subsystem documentation for detailed information

### For Operators
1. Read [Operator Panel Guide](./operator/README.md) for operator instructions
2. Read [API Documentation](./api/README.md) for API usage
3. Read [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md) for common issues

### For Users
1. Read [User Guide](./user/README.md) for user instructions
2. Read [API Documentation](./api/README.md) for API usage
3. Read [FAQ](./faq.md) for common questions

## Key Concepts

### Biomimetic Architecture
DreamNet uses biomimetic principles to create a self-healing, self-optimizing system:
- **Ants & Bees**: Distributed task execution
- **Octopus**: Adaptive behavior
- **Chameleon**: Environmental adaptation
- **Wolf Pack**: Coordinated hunting
- **Falcon**: Precision targeting
- **Dream Snail**: Persistent memory
- **Zen Garden**: Peaceful optimization
- **Dream Clouds**: Distributed storage

### Event-Driven Architecture
DreamNet uses an event-driven architecture:
- Events are captured and routed through Event Wormholes
- Events trigger actions (task creation, HALO cycles)
- Events are logged and queryable
- Events enable system-wide coordination

### Self-Healing
DreamNet has self-healing capabilities:
- HALO Loop analyzes system and detects weak points
- Tasks are generated to fix issues
- Tasks are dispatched to agents for execution
- System health is monitored via Alive Mode

### Self-Optimization
DreamNet optimizes itself:
- HALO Loop analyzes system performance
- Tasks are generated to optimize performance
- Memory DNA tracks system evolution
- Resonance Engine learns from patterns

### Self-Expansion
DreamNet expands itself:
- Graft Engine adds new modules
- Spore Engine distributes prompts and configs
- Dark Fabric generates code
- System grows organically
