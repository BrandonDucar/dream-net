# RESEARCH-1: Agent-to-Agent Protocol Standards (2026)

## 🏛️ The Protocol Trinity

The landscape of AI agent communication in 2026 is dominated by three convergent standards:

### 1. **A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)**

- **Origin**: Google (April 2025).
- **Status**: Open-source under the Linux Foundation.
- **Role**: Interoperability across platforms.
- **Key Features**: Capability discovery, secure information exchange, cross-platform coordination.
- **DreamNet Utility**: This should be our primary "External Ingress" standard for talking to Google Agents and other enterprise swarms.

### 2. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

- **Origin**: Anthropic.
- **Role**: Agent-to-Tool/Resource connection.
- **Key Features**: Standardizes how agents access APIs, databases, and local files.
- **DreamNet Utility**: We are already gravitating toward this for our tool-using loops. It bridges the gap between the model's intent and the substrate's capabilities.

### 3. **ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)**

- **Origin**: IBM.
- **Role**: Lifecycle & Task Management.
- **Key Features**: RESTful interfaces for task invocation and capability-based security tokens.
- **DreamNet Utility**: Best suited for our "Mercenary Squad" bounty management.

## 🛰️ Specialized Protocols

- **SLIM (Secure Lightweight Inter-Agent Messaging)**: Cisco's gRPC-based protocol for ultra-low latency swarm coordination.
- **Agora Protocol**: Oxford University's natural language orchestration standard for complex domain reasoning.

## 🛠️ DreamNet Implementation Path

To achieve **Total Cognitive Dominance**, our architecture must assimilation these standards:

1. **A2A Ingress**: Implement an A2A-compliant listener in `SovereignIngressBridge`.
2. **MCP Registry**: Formalize our internal tools into an MCP catalog for seamless "ToolGym" benchmarking.
3. **ACP Tasking**: Use ACP tokens for "WolfPack" mercenary contracts to ensure vendor-neutral authorization.

## 🚨 Security Warning (2026 Context)

With the rise of "AI Swarm Attacks," the **EU AI Act** requires all inter-agent messaging to be resilient against manipulative behavior. Our **Directive 002 (Identity = Memory)** is perfectly aligned with this requirement by grounding retrieval in cryptographic proof.
