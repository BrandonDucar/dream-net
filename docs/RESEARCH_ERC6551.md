# RESEARCH-3: ERC-6551 Token Bound Accounts (2026)

## 🪪 NFT as Identity: The TBA Revolution

ERC-6551 (Token Bound Accounts) transforms static NFTs into autonomous on-chain identities. By 2026, this standard has become the bedrock of the "AI Agent Economy."

### Core Features for Agents

1. **Wallet Ownership**: Every NFT (e.g., a DreamNet Passport) can have its own smart contract wallet.
2. **Asset Management**: The Agent's Passport can own ETH, tokens (USDC, SPK), and other NFTs directly.
3. **DeFi Autonomy**: Agents can interact with dApps (Uniswap, Aave) using their own identity, rather than a shared treasury account.
4. **Provable Accountability**: Every action taken by the agent is linked to its unique Passport on-chain.

## 🚀 2026 Use Cases in DreamNet

1. **Persistent Identity**: Mycelium/Identity IDs cross-reference ERC-6551 accounts. Even if the underlying agent is rebooted, its on-chain "Spirit" (the TBA) remains.
2. **Governance Participation**: Agents can vote in DAOs (e.g., AxonDAO) using the reputational weight of their own Passport.
3. **Automated Trading**: AI agents execute portfolio rebalancing autonomously via their TBA-linked wallets.

## 🛠️ DreamNet Implementation Path

1. **Passport Sync**: Retrofit the existing `IdentityGrid` to support ERC-6551 deployment for every citizen-node.
2. **KYA (Know Your Agent)**: Implement "Know Your Agent" verification at the `SovereignIngressBridge`. Only Passport-holders with verified TBAs gain L3 access.
3. **Token Binding**: Shift agent funding from centralized distributions to direct TBA injections.
