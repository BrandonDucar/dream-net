# SLU Pool Minimum Viable Amounts

## Minimum Requirements

### Per Pool Minimums

**Absolute Minimum (Not Recommended):**
- **$50 per pool** = $25 stSPK + $25 paired token
  - ⚠️ Very thin liquidity
  - High slippage risk
  - May not attract traders
  - Gas costs become significant % of value

**Minimum Viable (Barely Acceptable):**
- **$100 per pool** = $50 stSPK + $50 paired token
  - Still thin but functional
  - Some slippage on larger trades
  - Can start earning fees
  - Gas costs ~$5-10 per transaction

**Recommended Minimum (Healthy Start):**
- **$200 per pool** = $100 stSPK + $100 paired token
  - Good liquidity depth
  - Low slippage for normal trades
  - Attractive to traders
  - Gas costs reasonable (~1-2% of pool)

**Optimal Start:**
- **$500 per pool** = $250 stSPK + $250 paired token
  - Excellent liquidity
  - Minimal slippage
  - High fee generation
  - Professional-grade pool

## Starting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Ultra-Low Budget ($200 total)
**Start with 1 pool:**
- DREAM pool: $100 stSPK + $100 DREAM = $200 LP
- **Pros**: Can start earning, test the system
- **Cons**: Very limited, high gas % of value

### Scenario 2: Low Budget ($400 total)
**Start with 2 pools:**
- DREAM pool: $100 stSPK + $100 DREAM = $200 LP
- USDC pool: $100 stSPK + $100 USDC = $200 LP
- **Pros**: Diversified, still manageable
- **Cons**: Thin but functional

### Scenario 3: Minimum Viable ($600 total)
**Start with 3 pools:**
- DREAM pool: $100 stSPK + $100 DREAM = $200 LP
- USDC pool: $100 stSPK + $100 USDC = $200 LP
- ETH pool: $100 stSPK + $100 ETH = $200 LP
- **Pros**: Good coverage, healthy start
- **Cons**: SOL pool skipped (can add later)

### Scenario 4: Recommended Start ($800 total)
**Start with 4 pools:**
- DREAM pool: $100 stSPK + $100 DREAM = $200 LP
- USDC pool: $100 stSPK + $100 USDC = $200 LP
- ETH pool: $100 stSPK + $100 ETH = $200 LP
- SOL pool: $100 stSPK + $100 SOL = $200 LP
- **Pros**: All pools seeded, balanced
- **Cons**: Still on the smaller side

## Gas Cost Considerations

**Base Network Gas Costs (approximate):**
- Stake SPK → stSPK: ~$2-5
- Add liquidity (per pool): ~$3-8
- Claim rewards: ~$2-5
- Remove liquidity: ~$3-8

**Total Gas for Full Setup:**
- Staking: $2-5
- Adding to 4 pools: $12-32
- **Total: ~$15-40** (one-time setup cost)

**Gas as % of Pool Value:**
- $50 pool: 10-20% gas cost 😱
- $100 pool: 5-10% gas cost ⚠️
- $200 pool: 2-5% gas cost ✅
- $500 pool: <1% gas cost ✅✅

## Practical Recommendations

### If You Have Limited Budget:

**Option A: Start Small, Scale Later**
1. Start with **1 pool** ($200): DREAM pool
2. Test the system, earn rewards
3. Add more pools as you accumulate more tokens
4. **Gas cost**: ~$5-10 total

**Option B: Focus on Best Pairs**
1. Start with **2 pools** ($400): DREAM + USDC
2. These are most liquid/stable pairs
3. Skip ETH/SOL until you have more capital
4. **Gas cost**: ~$10-20 total

**Option C: Minimum All Pools**
1. Start with **4 pools** ($800): All pairs
2. $100 stSPK + $100 paired per pool
3. Thin but covers all bases
4. **Gas cost**: ~$15-40 total

### If You Want to Wait:

**Next Week Setup:**
- Save up for **$200-400 per pool**
- Start with 2-4 pools at $200-400 each
- Much healthier liquidity
- Better fee generation
- Lower gas % of value

## My Recommendation

**For $1000 stSPK:**

**This Week (if you want to start now):**
- Start with **1-2 pools** at $200-400 each
- Use $200-400 of your stSPK
- Keep rest for next week
- **Total needed**: $200-400 paired tokens

**Next Week (when you have paired tokens):**
- Add remaining pools
- Scale up existing pools
- **Total needed**: $600-800 more paired tokens

**Example:**
```
Week 1: DREAM pool ($200 stSPK + $200 DREAM)
Week 2: Add USDC ($300 stSPK + $300 USDC)
Week 3: Add ETH ($250 stSPK + $250 ETH)
Week 4: Add SOL ($150 stSPK + $150 SOL)
```

This spreads out the capital requirement and lets you test the system first!

---

**Bottom Line:**
- **Absolute minimum**: $50 per pool (not recommended)
- **Minimum viable**: $100 per pool (barely acceptable)
- **Recommended minimum**: $200 per pool (healthy start)
- **Optimal**: $500+ per pool (professional)

Start with what you can afford, scale up as you go! 🚀
