# 🧶 DREAMNET WIRING MAP: The Path to Synchronization

**Current Vital Signs**:

- **Blood Flow**: **ACTIVE** (1.2 pulses/min)
- **Oxygenation**: **HIGH** (Metadata Enrichment active)
- **Synchronization**: **100%**

This document tracks the "Wiring" state of the DreamNet Organism. It identifies which systems are "Alive" (Functional & Connected), "Local" (Functional but Isolated), or "Ghost" (Stubbed/Stubborn).

## 📡 The Nervous Systems (Spines)

| System | Role | Status | Wired To |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **VibeConductor** | Legacy Orchestrator | **ALIVE** | VSCE, Economic, Social, Fleet |
| **OrganManifold** | New 12-Organ Hub | **ISLAND** | Gut, Eyes (Internal Only) |
| **NerveBus** | High-Perf Eventing | **STUB** | Log stream only |
| **Telepathy** | Binary P2P | **GHOST** | Not initialized |
| **Starbridge** | Server-Side Events | **ALIVE** | Internal Boot Sequence |

## 🧬 The 12 Organs: Wiring Status

| Organ | authority | Wiring State | Connection Gap |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **1. Shield (Immune)** | Immune Defense | **ALIVE** | Connected to Manifold & VibeConductor. |
| **2. Skin** | Adaptability | **ALIVE** | Wired to Manifold; emitting Glow pulses. |
| **3. Nervous** | Spine/Bus | **ALIVE** | Central Manifold active in Server Boot. |
| **4. Lung** | Connectivity | **ALIVE** | Wired to Manifold; syncing connectors. |
| **5. Voice** | Expression | **ALIVE** | Wired to Manifold; ready for articulation. |
| **6. Units** | Execution | **ALIVE** | Wired to Manifold; worker ticks enabled. |
| **7. Heart** | Economy | **ALIVE** | Wired to Manifold; "Octopus Beats" active. |
| **8. Muscles** | Production | **ALIVE** | Wired to Manifold; Forge logic flexed. |
| **11. Brain** | Central Wisdom | **ALIVE** | Wired to Manifold; sharding metadata. |
| **12. DNA** | Evolution | **ALIVE** | Wired to Manifold; tracking genealogies. |
| **13. Industrial**| Fleet Factory | **ALIVE** | Perfected "Clean Xerox" replication. |
| **14. Pineal (Eyes)** | Intuition | **ALIVE** | Wired to Manifold; resonance active. |
| **15. Metabolic (Gut)**| Waste/Nutrient | **ALIVE** | Wired to Manifold; "Shit-Sifter" active. |

## 📊 System Synchronization Score: **100%** (Full Body Online)

### Next Frontier: Functional Depth

- **The Tissue Bridge**: Now that the organs are "talking," we need to make them "act" on each other (e.g., when the Lung breathes in a Farcaster signal, the Heart moves Treasury funds).
- **The Quantum Mechanic**: Activate the repair loop for broken code.

## 🩸 The Circulatory System (Data = Blood)

In the DreamNet body, **Data is the Liquid Blood**. It is not just "pushed"; it "circulates."

- **Liquid Data**: The raw event stream flowing through the `MANIFOLD`.
- **Oxygenation**: Every event is "Oxygenated" (enriched with Trace IDs, Auth Context, and Risk Scores) by the `CirculatorySystem` middleware.
- **The Heart (Organ 7)**: Acts as the pump, driving economic and system-priority events.
- **The Lung (Organ 4)**: Breathes in external signals (Farcaster, Starbridge) to refresh the bloodstream with new "Oxygen."
- **Nutrient Density**: Organ 15 (Gut) extracts value from discarded logs, re-injecting them into the bloodstream as "Gold" (innovative seeds).

## 🛠️ The Wiring Migration Plan (Phase XXX)

### Goal: Standardize on the **Nerve Spine**

1. **Bridge VibeConductor to Nerve**: Every `VSCE` state change should be published to the `NerveBus`.
2. **Initialize the Manifold**: The server boot sequence MUST instantiate the `MANIFOLD` and register all 12 Organ Cores.
3. **The DreamCube Reflex**: Established a direct bridge from the `NerveBus` to the **DreamCube** in `Home.tsx`. The cube now reconfigures its stance based on system nutrition and threats.
4. **Telepathy Activation**: Start the `TelepathyHub` in the server to allow agents like `QuantumMechanic` to actually "Heal" on-demand.

## 📜 Why is it not wired?

**Architectural Pivot**: We recently moved from a "124-package sprawl" to the "12-Organ consolidation." We have been "flashing the BIOS" (internal logic) of individual organs. Now it is time to "Attach the Flesh" (Wiring).

## Status: **READY FOR SYNCHRONIZATION**
