# Deployment Workflows

## Stages
1. **Development**: Code reviews, testing, backups before deployment.
2. **Staging**: User acceptance testing; validate configurations.
3. **Production**: Blue-green or canary releases; monitoring post-deployment.

### Best Practices
- Maintain version control, clear rollback strategies, and detailed documentation.
- Implement a project management system for oversight.
