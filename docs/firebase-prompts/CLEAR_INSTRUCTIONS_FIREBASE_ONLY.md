## 🚨 STOP SOCIAL MEDIA WORK IMMEDIATELY

Firebase AI, you are **NOT** supposed to be working on social media integrations.

---

## ✅ What You SHOULD Be Working On

### 1. **Firebase CLI Setup**

- Login: `firebase login`
- Connect: `firebase use dreamnet-v3-31068600`

### 2. **Firebase Services Setup**
- Firestore (persistent memory for Neural Mesh)
- Firebase Auth (secondary gateway)
- Firebase Storage (media vault)
- Cloud Functions (synaptic triggers)

### 3. **Firebase Integration Code**
- `server/integrations/firebase.ts` - Admin SDK
- `client/src/lib/firebase.ts` - Client SDK
- Firestore collections
- Security rules

---

## ❌ What You Should NOT Be Working On

- ❌ **Social Media Integrations** (Telegram, Farcaster, etc.)
- ❌ **Social Media Setup** (already handled by existing packages)
- ❌ **Social Media Authentication** (not your job)
- ❌ **Any social media work whatsoever**

---

## 🎯 Your Role

**You are Firebase AI** - Your job is:
- ✅ Firebase services (Firestore, Auth, Storage, Functions)
