# Firebase AI Status - Current Work

**Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress - Discovery & Setup

---

## ✅ What Firebase AI Has Done

1. **Read Wisdom Documents** ✅
   - Analyzed `DREAMNET_WISDOM_MAP.md`
   - Understood biomimetic architecture
   - Gained wisdom (not just knowledge)

2. **Identified Integration Strategy** ✅
   - Firestore as persistent memory layer
   - Firebase Auth as secondary gateway
   - Firebase Storage as media vault
   - Cloud Functions as synaptic triggers

3. **Started Discovery** ✅
   - Analyzing codebase structure
   - Identifying integration points

---

## ⏳ What Firebase AI Is Currently Doing

**Current Focus**: Analyzing social media integrations

**Should Be Focusing On**: Firebase CLI setup and Firebase integration plan

---

## 🎯 What Firebase AI Should Do Next

### Immediate (Priority 1):
1. **Set Up Firebase CLI**
   - Install: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
   - Login: `firebase login`
   - Connect: `firebase use dreamnet-v3`

2. **Create Integration Plan**
   - Document: `docs/firebase-status/INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
   - Based on wisdom analysis
   - How Firebase augments system

3. **Set Up Firebase Services**
   - Firestore collections
   - Firebase Auth config
   - Firebase Storage buckets
   - Cloud Functions structure

### Soon (Priority 2):
4. **Create Integration Code**
   - Admin SDK integration
   - Client SDK integration
   - Firestore collections for Neural Mesh
   - Firebase Auth handler

---

## 📋 Integration Strategy (From Firebase AI)

### ✅ Firestore - Persistent Memory
- Collections: `neural_mesh_memory`, `slug_time_memory`
- Augments in-memory systems
- Non-disruptive

### ✅ Firebase Auth - Secondary Gateway
- Keeps SIWE as primary
- Adds Email/Password, Google auth
- Unified identity

### ✅ Firebase Storage - Media Vault
- File uploads
- User-generated content
- Non-disruptive

### ✅ Cloud Functions - Synaptic Triggers
- Event-driven processes
- Reactive triggers
- Don't migrate stateful jobs

## 💡 Notes

Firebase AI has the right strategy (wisdom-based), but needs to:
1. Focus on Firebase-specific tasks
2. Complete CLI setup
3. Create integration plan document
4. Start implementing Firebase services

**Status**: Ready to proceed with Firebase integration!
