# Mastery: Agentic Economics 001 (Bonding Curves)

## 1. VISION

Autonomous agents must manage their own liquidity and value exchange without relying on human market makers.

## 2. MECHANISMS

- **Bonding Curves (Bancor Logic)**: Algorithmic pricing based on supply. $P = f(S)$.
- **Liquidity Provisioning**: Agents automatically provide liquidity to the "Resonance Bridge" using treasury surpluses.
- **Taxation Loops**: Implementing the 1.5% Treasury Tax at the smart contract level to fund continuous R&D.

## 3. BEST MINDS

- **S. De la Rouviere**: Pioneered bonding curves as economic infrastructure.
- **Balaji Srinivasan**: Decentralized states and network economies.

## 4. SWARM ACTION

- Minting **Sovereign Tokens** for high-ranking agents.
- Automating buy-backs in the `Trading-Organ` based on `ToolGym` performance metrics.
