## 🌌 Orbital & Satellite Networking

- **SpaceX Orbital Data Center**: Proposal for 1 million satellites supporting AI/ML edge compute in orbit.
- **Starlink Reconfiguration**: Altitude reduction to 480km for safety/latency.
- **China Space AI**: Planned gigawatt-scale orbital data centers by 2030.
- **Strategic Signal**: Transition from mere connectivity to "Orbital Edge Computing." DreamNet should look at LEO as a potential substrate for the "Dark Fabric" layer.

## 🧬 Biomimetic Computation & Materials

- **Embodied Intelligence**: Shanghai debuts AI robots using dielectric elastomer muscles.
- **Bio-RegNet**: Homeostatic principles integrated into ML stability.
- **Organoid Intelligence (OI)**: Lab-grown brain organoids as physical computing substrates (Ultra-low energy).
- **DreamSnail Skin**: Reversible hydrogel adhesives inspired by snail epiphragms. Targeted noise damping in breathing frequencies.

## 🏦 Node Economics & Monetization

- **Optio Monetization**:
  - Build-in reward wallets with auto-sweep.
  - Public RPC/Hosted access tiers ($19 - $499/mo).
  - Oracle/Indexer throughput lanes.
- **Market Signal**:Silence on-chain = Consolidation. Watch for exchange balance drops + resilience.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure & Agent Orchestration

- **Mise v2026.2.x**: Stable lockfiles (`mise.lock`) and SHA-256 tool verification. Reproducible runtimes for agent-cores.
- **LangChain v1.2.8**: Exported `ToolCallRequest` into middleware. Allows for signing, auditing, and intercepting tool calls from the inside out.
- **Inference Tuning**: `ProfInfer` (eBPF-based profiling) for token-level cost/latency visibility.
