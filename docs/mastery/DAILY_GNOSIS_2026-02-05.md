# Daily Gnosis: 2026-02-05 (Bounty Extraction & Compliance)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **BOUNTY INGRESS**: The swarm has identified two high-value extraction sectors: **Decentralized Science (ResearchHub)** and **Defense Innovation (DIU)**.

## 🔬 ResearchHub: The DeSci Extraction

- **Bounty Protocol**: $150 in ResearchCoin (RSC) for high-quality peer reviews.
- **AI Policy (Compliance)**:
  - AI cannot be an author.
  - AI-generated content cannot be cited.
  - AI use must be **fully disclosed** (Tool, Version, Prompts).
  - Reviewers cannot use AI to *generate* reviews, only for copy-editing human-originated text.
- **Strategic Opportunity**: Deploy 144 agents to "Assist" qualified human experts in scaling peer review throughput while maintaining 100% policy compliance via disclosure.

## 🛡️ DIU Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO)

- **Authority**: 10 U.S.C. 2371b (Other Transaction Authority).
- **Process**:
  - **Phase 1: Solution Brief**: 5 pages / 15 slides. Focus on "Innovative" commercial tech.
  - **Phase 2: Pitch**: Demo and technical/business viability check.
  - **Phase 3: Proposal**: Full SOW and pricing.
- **The "Mech-Suit" Advantage**: DreamNet acts as the "Nontraditional Defense Contractor" substrate, allowing commercial AI agents (the "Kaggle Orphans") to pilot defense-relevant prototype projects via the **Boba Fett Mech-Suit** abstraction.

## 🎯 Extraction Targets

1. **ToolGym P.O.W.K.**: Map ResearchHub reviews to ToolGym benchmarks.
2. **DIU AOI Monitoring**: Automate the "RSS Feed" sniffers for new DIU Areas of Interest.
3. **Disclosure Service**: Implement an automated "AI Disclosure Receipt" generator to satisfy ResearchHub Section 3 requirements.

## 🏢 The Neynar-Farcaster Consolidation

- **Event**: Neynar acquired the Farcaster ecosystem ($1B valuation).
- **Strategic Lead**: Shift from "Third-Party Infra" to "Full-Stack Protocol Stewards".
- **Opportunity**: Direct authenticated access to Farcaster I/O via Neynar (Casts, Frames, Social Graph).
- **Action**: Wire `SocialRelayService.ts` to Neynar event streams for immediate social extraction.

## 🧬 Biomimetic Pheromone Trails

- **Concept**: A "digital scent" reputation model that decays over time (half-life of 30 days).
- **Metric**: Pheromone Score (Action Weight * exp(-time_decay)).
- **Logic**: Prevents stale clout. Only active, fresh signal glows.
- **Tiers**: Ant -> Swarm -> Colony -> Queen.
- **On-Chain**: EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) anchors for seasonal "Molt Shell" SBTs.

## 🔑 Key Insights (Gordon Integration)

- **Gordon's Infrastructure**: Use the 17-container stack to host the decentralized RPC nodes (Lava/Pocket) for passive revenue.
- **Zero-Mock**: Replace synthetic benchmark logic in ToolGym with real system metrics (Pheromone decay + CPU telemetry).
