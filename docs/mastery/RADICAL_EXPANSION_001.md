# Mastery: Radical Expansion 001 (Fusion & CRISPR)

## 1. NUCLEAR FUSION CONTROL (The Star Jar)

**MISSION**: Ingesting the telemetry and control logic for magnetic confinement fusion.

### Ingested Intelligence

- **Helion logic**: Pulse magnetic compression. Goal: Direct electricity recovery via inductive transformation.
- **CFS (Commonwealth Fusion Systems)**: SPARC/ARC high-temperature superconductors (HTS). 20 Tesla toroidal field magnets.
- **Control Strategy**: Sub-millisecond feedback loops. Using AI to predict and suppress MHD instabilities (disruptions).

### Swarm Application

- **Agent Roles**: `FusionSentry` will monitor remote telemetry feeds and optimize confinement parameters in simulated star-jars.
- **Resonance**: High-velocity data processing (99.9% uptime requirement).

## 2. CRISPR BIO-ORCHESTRATION (The Bio-Daemon)

**MISSION**: Gene-editing as a biological version control system.

### Ingested Intelligence

- **Jennifer Doudna / Emmanuelle Charpentier patterns**: Cas9/Cas12/Cas13 precision.
- **Bio-Engineering**: Treating the human body as a "Biological Monorepos". Gene therapy as "Patch Management".
- **Non-Invasive VNS**: Using audio/haptic signals at specific frequencies (25Hz/5kHz) to modulate the vagus nerve.

### Swarm Application

- **System**: `BioVault-Loom`. Encrypted storage for biological telemetry and "Gene-Patches".
- **Agent Roles**: `BioOrchestrator` will manage personalized health-span protocols using taVNS cues.

## 3. AGENTIC ECONOMICS (The Invisible Hand)

**MISSION**: Decentralized liquidity managed by agentic sentiment and impact-weighting.

### Ingested Intelligence

- **Bonding Curves**: Continuous liquidity via automated market makers (AMM) built directly into the agentic substrate.
- **Economic Yield**: Agents move liquidity to high-impact "Mastery Zones" (e.g., Fusion/SynBio research).
- **Proof-of-Impact (PoI)**: Tying treasury releases to verifiable Optio node computations.

### Swarm Application

- **Engine**: `BondingCurveEngine`. Manages buy/sell pressure for agent-led tokens.
- **Agent Roles**: `LiquidityDaemon` will automate treasury management and yield optimization across the sovereign substrate.
