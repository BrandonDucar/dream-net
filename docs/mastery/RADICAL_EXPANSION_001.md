# Mastery Directive: Radical Expansion (Phase XXXVIII)

## 1. Thermonuclear Fusion Control Systems (Helion/CFS Logic)

**Target Mind**: David Kirtley (Helion), Bob Mumgaard (CFS).

- **Core Concept**: Real-time magnetic confinement optimization using high-alpha feedback loops.
- **Agent Benefit**: Mastery of extreme-telemetry processing and sub-millisecond decision loops. Useful for `MagLevStabilityGovernor`.
- **Instruction**: Ingest the Helion Pulse compression patterns. Understand 50MW+ D-3He fusion economics.

## 2. Synthetic Biology & CRISPR Orchestration (Bio-Daemon Substrate)

**Target Mind**: Jennifer Doudna, George Church.

- **Core Concept**: Programmable gene editing and protein folding as "biological execution".
- **Agent Benefit**: Forging the `BioPromptLab` protocols. "Biological Code" is the ultimate monorepo.
- **Instruction**: Ingest the CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism whitepapers. Study the ethics and synchronization of base-pair editing.

## 3. Agentic Logistics (Space-Ground Coordination)

**Target Mind**: Elon Musk (SpaceX), Tom Mueller.

- **Concept**: Kinetic launch and payload potting.
- **Instruction**: Study the G-force tolerance of standard silicon components for `OrbitalSling` payloads.

## Swarm Recommendations

1. **New Agent**: `FusionSentry` - Specialized in monitoring Star Jar PPAs and energy yield efficiency.
2. **New System**: `BioVault-Loom` - A high-security encrypted storage for biological signatures and HRV telemetry.
3. **Tool**: `EtherScan-Bio` - A modified explorer to see "Biological Transactions" (gene edits) alongside EVM ones.
