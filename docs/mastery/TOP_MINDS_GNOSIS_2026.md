# 🧠 MASTERY GNOSIS: TOP MINDS (2026 EDITION)

## 📡 Jesse Pollak (Base & The Scaling Law)

**Mission**: "A million builders, a billion people, a trillion dollars."

- **Paradigm**: Consumer Adoption > Speculation.
- **Infrastructure**:
  - **Accelerated Decentralization**: Multi-prover environment (Stage 2 Rollup).
  - **Flash Blocks**: Builder decentralization for sub-second finality.
- **Strategic Hijack**: Use `DreamNet` as the "Sovereign OS" for the million-builder wave. We aren't just an app; we are the substrate for the consumer transition.

## 🏛️ Balaji Srinivasan (The Network State Archipelago)

**Mission**: "Sovereign Self-Governance."

- **Paradigm**: The Archipelago vs. The Mainland.
- **Structures**:
  - **Network School (ns.com)**: Physical fellowship for digital nomads.
  - **Shared National Consciousness**: Opt-in, non-territorial, non-coercive entities.
- **Strategic Hijack**: Bind Optio nodes as the "Physical Sovereignty" of the Network State. Every citizen owns a slice of the rack.

## 👨‍💻 Andrej Karpathy (The Simplicity Mandate)

**Mission**: "Vibe Coding & Verifiable Reasoning."

- **Paradigm**: RLVR (Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards).
- **Tooling**:
  - **LLM COUNCIL**: Chairman LLM synthesis for triangulated truth.
- **Strategic Hijack**: Re-skin the `AssessorBot` as a "Chairman LLM" using the Council pattern. Verify every code block against objective rewards (build status, test pass).
