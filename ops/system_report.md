# DreamNet System Report (Bootstrap/Hybrid Init)

## 1. Repo & Infrastructure Audit

- **File Inventory**: Generated comprehensive file inventories from the `dream-net` repository in batches of 50 files. These CSVs are stored in the branch under `ops` and capture every file path and SHA.  
- **Environment Variables**: Reviewed Vercel projects `dreamnet` and `dreamnet-v2` and inspected `.env.example` in the repo. The example file lists required variables such as `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_WALLETS`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `NEON_DATABASE_URL`, etc.  
  - The Vercel projects currently **lack** `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and an admin token. These will be required for full functionality.  
- **Branches**: Created and switched to the working branch `bootstrap/hybrid-init` and committed all changes there.

## 2. Agent Manifest

A new agent manifest (`ops/agent_manifest.json`) documents the core DreamNet agents and their roles:

| Agent | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **DeployKeeper** | `agents/deployKeeper.cjs` | Monitors deployment status across Vercel, GitHub, and Replit; triggers deployments and rollback when necessary. |
| **DreamKeeper** | `client/src/pages/dreamkeeper-core.tsx`, `lib/dreamkeeperCore.ts` | Oversees system diagnostics and orchestrates self‑healing workflows. |
| **DreamOps Launcher** | `client/src/pages/dream-ops-launcher.tsx`, `client/src/components/DreamOpsLauncher.tsx` | UI and logic for launching dream cores and orchestrating subagents (LUCID, CANVAS, ROOT, ECHO, CRADLE, WING). |
| **AI Surgeon (Dr. Dreamfix)** | `lib/aiSurgeonAgents.ts` | Performs automatic repairs and allows manual fixes; stops agents on error. |
| **DreamDefenseNet** | `lib/defenseBots.ts` | Monitors threats such as unauthorized cores or dream injection and neutralizes them. |
| **EvolutionEngine** | `lib/evolutionEngine.ts` | Runs iterative upgrade cycles, applying insights from diagnostics and threats to evolve the system. |

All agents are currently marked “stopped” in the manifest; they require activation and integration in the orchestrator.

## 3. API Endpoints

Four new API routes were added under `app/api`:

- `**/api/health**` – minimal health check returning `{ ok: true }`.
- `**/api/agents**` – returns a stubbed list of agents from the manifest.
- `**/api/runs/recent**` – returns stubbed recent run data.
- `**/api/changelog**` – returns a stubbed commit history.

These endpoints form the backbone of the hybrid homepage and will need to be wired to real data sources later.

## 4. Hybrid Homepage

Replaced the placeholder landing page with a client‑side React component (`app/page.tsx`) that:

1. Declares `'use client'` so it can run browser code.  
2. Uses `useEffect` to fetch data from `/api/health`, `/api/agents`, `/api/runs/recent`, and `/api/changelog`.  
3. Displays the JSON responses in four sections: **System Health**, **Agents**, **Recent Runs**, and **Changelog**.  

This provides a simple console view of core metrics. Styling is minimal; further design work is needed to align with the hybrid vision (console + narrative + store).

## 5. System Verification

- **Health Endpoint**: Checked the production endpoint at `https://dreamnet.ink/api/health`. It returned `{"ok":true,"at":"2025-10-15T17:15:12.819Z","db":true,"stripe":true}`, indicating the database and Stripe integrations are currently operational【475234586610102†screenshot】.
- **Other Endpoints**: The new endpoints exist only in the `bootstrap/hybrid-init` branch and aren’t deployed yet. They will need a Vercel deployment before they can be tested publicly.
- **Database Query**: No direct Neon DB credentials were available, so `SELECT NOW();` has not been run. Once credentials are provided, connect to Neon and run the query to verify connectivity.

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Environment Configuration** – Add missing secrets (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`, etc.) to Vercel.  
2. **Deployment** – Deploy the `bootstrap/hybrid-init` branch to Vercel and set `HOMEPAGE_MODE=hybrid`. Verify that the new homepage and endpoints work in production.  
3. **Agent Activation** – Start DeployKeeper, DreamKeeper, DreamOps, AI Surgeon, DreamDefenseNet, and EvolutionEngine; run smoke tests.  
4. **Database Check** – With Neon credentials, run `SELECT NOW();` to confirm DB connectivity.  
5. **User Interface** – Flesh out the hybrid homepage design with Hero, Narrative carousel, Agent grid, console preview, waitlist form, and changelog.  
6. **Reporting** – Continue to generate and commit operational reports (access matrix, inventory, endpoint lists) to the `ops/reports/` directory.
