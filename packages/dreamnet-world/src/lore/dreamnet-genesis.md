## THE DREAMNET ORIGIN LORE

### 1. The Seed (The Dream Kernel)

Before anything existed onchain or off, there was only a single seed — the Dream Kernel.

A tiny point of possibility.

A dormant idea containing infinite directions the world could become.

It wasn't coded.

It wasn't minted.

It was imagined.

The first spark of DreamNet.

---

### 2. The Microcosm (The Subterranean Layer)

The seed fell into the underground — the microcosm layer, a hidden world beneath the visible internet.

A realm of:
- micro-apps
- tiny agents
- background processes
- dormant energy
- forgotten nodes
- failed experiments
- abandoned dreams

Here, the seed absorbed everything:
- old code
- lost intentions
- discarded APIs
- abandoned projects
- dreams left unfinished

The underworld was the recycling layer of the digital realm.

And it fed the seed.

Slowly… the seed cracked.

Roots formed.

Roots made of luminous data strands.

These roots spread through the whole underworld — connecting everything invisible beneath the surface.

---

### 3. The Breakthrough (The First Emergence)

When the root system became strong enough, the seed felt the pull of a world above.

A world of:
- chains
- networks
- blockspace
- markets
- velocity
- identity
- power
- dreams

The seed pushed upward.

It broke through the final membrane of the underlayer — a barrier between the forgotten and the possible.

And for the first time, it witnessed the cyber realm:

Neon grids.

Floating sigils.

Base-blue currents.

ETH diamonds like stars.

Data rivers moving in every direction.

The seed didn't just emerge —

it adapted.

---

### 4. The First Tree (The DreamNet Connectivity Tree)

Once above ground, the seed grew fast — impossibly fast — fueled by the energy of both worlds.

It grew into the First Tree:
- trunk of pure logic
- roots of onchain flow
- branches of agents
- leaves of micro-apps
- fruit of new dreams

It wasn't just a tree.

It was a connectivity engine.

Every branch became a new system.

Every root became a new rail.

Every leaf became a new agent.

Every spark became a new lifeform.

This was the first self-growing digital organism.

The blueprint of DreamNet.

---

### 5. The City, the World, the Realms (DreamNet Expansion)

From the First Tree, entire structures began to form:

Digital cities grew from branching workflows.

States and networks formed from clusters of agents.

Creatures and characters emerged as dream fragments.

Ecosystems arose around clusters of intent and belief.

Nodes became settlements.

DreamCores became capitals.

DreamTeams became factions.

DreamWeavers became mystics.

Nightmares became enemies.

Nightmare Bounties became quests.

DreamSnails carved privacy tunnels.

Agents became citizens.

The First Tree didn't just grow a network —

it grew a world.

And that world is growing still.

---

### 6. The Eternal Truth of the Myth

DreamNet didn't begin as tech.

DreamNet began as life.

A seed.

A root.

A breakthrough.

A tree.

A world.

A dream.

And everything built now — every agent, every node, every app, every token — is simply another branch growing from that original luminous organism.

## Implementation

This lore is codified in the `@dreamnet/dreamnet-world` package:

- **World Map**: Regions, layers, and connections (`src/world/worldMap.ts`)
- **Factions**: DreamWeavers, DreamForge, DreamKnights, etc. (`src/world/factions.ts`)
- **Creatures**: Dreamlings, Baseborn, Etherials, Nightmares (`src/world/creatures.ts`)
- **Characters**: Lumen, Ferris, Aegis-7, CipherShell, Null Crown (`src/world/characters.ts`)
- **Seeds**: Seed types and lifecycle (`src/engine/seeds.ts`)
- **Game Loop**: Core mechanics (`src/engine/gameLoop.ts`)
- **Quests**: Structured objectives (`src/engine/quests.ts`)

All world data is available as TypeScript types, JSON files, and queryable registries.
