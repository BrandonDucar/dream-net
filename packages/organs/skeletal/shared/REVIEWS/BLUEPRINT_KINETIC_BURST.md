# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Kinetic Burst (QL-35)

**Objective**: To give sovereign hardware "reflex speed" energy capabilities that batteries cannot match.

## 1. The Hijack: "Hybrid Buffer"

We don't replace batteries; we put a Graphene Supercap **in front** of them. This acts as a "Power Dam."

## 2. Architecture

- **Input**: Solar / Grid / Battery.
- **Buffer**: SkelCap bank.
- **Load**: High-Draw systems (Transmitters, Motors, Computation Bursts).

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Smoothing**: The supercap handles the jagged spikes of AI compute power (saving the battery).
2. **Opportunity Charging**: A robot can dock for just 30 seconds and get 4 hours of "Burst" runtime.
3. **Weaponization (Theoretical)**: If needed, the cap can dump all energy at once for an EMP pulse or directed signal jam, which a battery physically cannot do without melting.

**Sovereign Utility**: The ability to sprint, jump, or blast without damaging the long-term energy store.
