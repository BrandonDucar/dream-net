# 🏗️ Blueprint: Microtubule Compute Grid (Avenue 21)

**Purpose**: To enable "Non-Algorithmic" processing and quantum-like coherence in the DreamNet agent swarm.

## 1. Architectural Overview

The Microtubule Grid replaces the standard "Bus" architecture with a "Resonance" architecture. It treats agents as dipoles that can oscillate in phase.

```

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 The Tubulin Node

A standard agent node wrapped in a "Quantum Shell." It maintains two internal states simultaneously (Proposal A and Proposal B) until a "Collapse Criteria" is met.

### 2.2 The Coherence Pump

A heartbeat signal (see QL-13) that keeps the network in sync. It prevents premature "decoherence" (decision making) until enough information has gathered across the swarm.

### 2.3 The Oracle RNG

An interface to a true Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) service (e.g., ID Quantique or ANU Quantum Random). This injects non-computable entropy into the system.

## 3. Implementation Workflow (Agent-Lead)

1. **[Neural Mesh]**: Implement `SuperpositionState.ts` class that holds multiple conflicting values.
2. **[Governance]**: Defines the `ObjectiveReduction()` function—the threshold of consensus required to collapse the state into a decision.
3. **[Testing]**: Run a "Maze" simulation where the agent explores all paths simultaneously (Quantum Walk) rather than sequentially.
