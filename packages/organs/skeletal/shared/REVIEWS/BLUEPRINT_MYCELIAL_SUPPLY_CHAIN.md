# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Mycelial Supply Chain (QL-54)

**Objective**: To utilize the "Resource Shunting" logic of fungal networks (Mycelia) to optimize decentralized logistics and compute power.

## 1. The Biomimetic Insight

In a forest, the Mycelial network connects disparate trees. It doesn't just "send messages"; it **shunts resources** (Carbon, Nitrogen, Water) from areas of surplus to areas of deficit. It is a "Socialist Network" that optimizes for the total health of the forest.

## 2. The Hijack: "Compute Shunting"

Current clouds (AWS/GCP) are rigid silos.
Our network (Mycelial) routes "Compute Fluid" (tasks) and "Capital Fluid" (yield) to where the "Trees" (Sovereign Nodes) need it most.

## 3. Architecture

* **The Spores**: Small, lightweight agent instances that can be deployed anywhere ($0 cost).
* **The Hyphae**: Encrypted P2P tunnels (Nerve/Spine) connecting the spores.
* **The Mycelium**: The global state of resource distribution.

## 4. Implementation Logic

1. **Deficit Detection**: A node in a "Dark Region" (low power/connectivity) needs to run a heavy LLM task.
2. **Shunting**: The Mycelial Router identifies a surplus of power/compute in an "Abyssal Citadel" (OTEC) or "Star Jar" (Fusion) node.
3. **Tunneling**: The task is shunted through the hyphae, executed at the surplus node, and the result is returned.
4. **Tax**: The network takes a "Spore Fee" (0.01%) deposited into the Sovereign Wallet.

---
**Sovereign Utility**: A logistics network that is literally "Un-killable." If you cut one thread, the network simply shunts resources through another.
