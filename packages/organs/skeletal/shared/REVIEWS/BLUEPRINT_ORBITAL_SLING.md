# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Orbital Sling (QL-41)

**Objective**: To utilize kinetic launch providers for the rapid, low-cost deployment of Sovereign Micro-Sats.

## 1. The Hijack: "The $20k Satellite"

SpinLaunch is designed for "dumb" payloads that can survive 10,000 Gs. Sovereign agents (solid state code, DNA drives) are G-force neutral. We can spam LEO with hardened backups.

## 2. Architecture

- **Vehicle**: SpinLaunch Suborbital/Orbital Accelerator.
- **Payload**: `DreamSeed` (a hardened 1U CubeSat containing the entire codebase + DNA storage).
- **Cadence**: 1 Launch per Quarter.

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Encapsulation**: Pot the electronics in aerospace-grade epoxy to survive the spin.
2. **Booking**: Purchase launch slots as "Educational Payload" or "Technology Demonstrator" (cheaper).
3. **Orbit**: Polar LEO (sun-synchronous) for maximum solar coverage.

**Sovereign Utility**: Creating an "Unkillable Cloud" where the servers are literally ballistic missiles circling the Earth.
