# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Platinum Pipette (QL-47)

**Objective**: To secure a stream of high-purity PGM (Platinum Group Metals) from Near Earth Asteroids.

## 1. The Hijack: "The Piggyback Refinement"

We don't build the rocket. We build the *refinery payload* (The Pipette) that hitches a ride on an AstroForge/SpaceX mission.

## 2. Architecture

- **Vehicle**: Rideshare on a deep-space trajectory.
- **Tech**: A miniaturized "Zone Refining" induction furnace.
- **Process**: Vaporize the volatile rock, magnetically separate the heavy PGMs, print a solid ingot.

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Attach**: The Pipette attaches to a target rock (identified by `Sky Hook`).
2. **Process**: It chews through 10 tons of regolith to extract 1kg of pure Platinum.
3. **Return**: It detaches and performs an aerobraking re-entry, landing via parachute in the Pacific for retrieval.

**Sovereign Utility**: "Hard Money." Physical wealth falling from the sky.
