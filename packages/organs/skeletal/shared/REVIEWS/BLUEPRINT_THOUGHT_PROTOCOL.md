# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Thought Protocol (QL-44)

**Objective**: To prepare DreamNet for a "No-UI" future where the operator controls agents via BCI.

## 1. The Hijack: "The Latency Collapse"

We replace the "Prompt Engineering" layer with a "Neural Intent" layer. The agent doesn't wait for text; it reacts to specific firing patterns associated with "Execute" or "Abort."

## 2. Architecture

- **Hardware**: Consumer BCI (e.g., Neurable, Neurosity) or Medical (Neuralink feed if API opens).
- **Decoder**: A localized Transformer model trained on *your* specific brainwaves (EEG/LFP).
- **Action**: `Thought -> Intent -> Agent Action`.

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Calibration**: Train the model by thinking "Run Archimedes" 100 times while capturing the neural signature.
2. **Mapping**: Bind that signature to the `archimedes.execute()` function.
3. **Security**: A "Neural Handshake" (Bio-auth). Only *your* brain pattern can unlock the sovereign wallet.

**Sovereign Utility**: The ultimate 2-Factor Authentication. The key is the electrical pattern of your own consciousness.
