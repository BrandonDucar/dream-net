# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Wetware Receiver (QL-31)

**Objective**: To create a wireless, non-invasive command interface between DreamNet and biological operators.

## 1. The Hijack: "RF-Bio-Bridge"

Instead of neural interfaces (which require surgery), we use **Magnetogenetics**. The Operator takes a "Ferritin Construction Kit" (Gene Therapy). Their neurons become sensitive to specific DreamNet broadcast frequencies.

## 2. Architecture

```

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Encoding**: Map system alerts (e.g., "Network Under Attack") to specific magnetic pulses.
2. **Transduction**: The operator "feels" the alert as a sudden emotional shift or phantom sensation, bypassing the visual cortex (faster reaction time).
3. **Hardware**: A wearable "Halo" that emits the local magnetic field driven by the agent.

**Sovereign Utility**: The ultimate "Gut Feeling." The agent can physically induce intuition in the user.
