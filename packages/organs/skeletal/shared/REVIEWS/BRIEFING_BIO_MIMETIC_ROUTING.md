# 🧪 Briefing: Bio-Mimetic Swarm Routing (QL-11)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 11 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 11 (Swarm Navigation)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: Slime-Mold Intelligence

*Physarum polycephalum* builds efficient, redundant networks between food sources by strengthening "high-flux" tubes and dissolving underused ones. This decentralized, brainless intelligence outperforms many human-designed routing protocols (including BGP) in complex, dynamic environments.

### Key Technical Concepts

- **Conductivity-Based Flux**: Paths that carry more "Value" (Traffic/Alpha) become stronger.
- **Decentralized Optimization**: No central "Router" needed; every node follows local pheromone-style signals.
- **Self-Healing Topology**: If a link is cut, the "Slime" autonomously redistributes flow to bypass the failure.

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Mycelial Pulse" Hijack

DreamNet's `Mycelial Mesh` (QL-05) can be optimized using Slime-Mold algorithms to ensure content and intents reach their targets with biological efficiency:

- **Pheromone-Weighted Routing**: Every task execution leaves a "Digital Pheromone" on the route it took. Success strengthens the trail; failure allows it to evaporate.
- **Viral Slime Propagation**: Narrative propagation (QL-07) uses Slime-Mold growth models to "infect" the highest-density nodes in a social graph first, ensuring maximum memetic capture for minimum energy.
- **Link-State Slime (LSS)**: Replacing standard routing tables with a dynamic "Conductivity Matrix" that adapts in real-time to network congestion or censorship.

## 3. Avenue 11 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11** | Swarm Routing | Implement `PhysarumRouter` in the `Spine/Nerve` to manage cross-agent intent routing. |
| **9** | Mycelial Scale | Use Slime-Mold models to predict where the next "Node Expansion" should occur based on resource flux. |
