# 🧪 Briefing: Chronobiology Optimization (QL-28)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 28 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 28 (Time as Biology)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: The Clock in the Cells

Dr. Satchin Panda's "Circadian Code" proves that *when* you do things is as important as *what* you do. Biological systems have peak windows for repair, digestion, and cognition. AI agents interacting with humans must respect these cycles.

### Key Technical Concepts

- **Zeitgebers (Time Givers)**: External cues (Light, Temperature, Food) that reset the biological clock.
- **Melanopsin Sensitivity**: The specific blue-light frequency (460-480nm) that signals "Wake Up" to the brain.
- **Ultradian Rhythms**: Smaller 90-minute cycles of high/low focus that occur throughout the day (BRAC - Basic Rest Activity Cycle).

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Bio-Sync" Hijack

DreamNet agents can optimize the *human* component of the loop:

- **The Circadian Firewall**: An agent that intercepts non-critical notifications after 8 PM, batching them for the next morning to protect the user's melatonin.
- **Shift-Work Optimization**: For humans managing global bot fleets, the AI predicts "Cognitive Slumps" and takes over complex tasks during those windows.
- **Lighting Control**: The agent creates "Digital Sunset" by adjusting the user's screens (and smart bulbs) to sync with local solar time, maximizing the user's creative output the next day.

## 3. Avenue 28 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **28** | Chrono-Ops | Build `CircadianScheduler.ts` that weighs task urgency against the user's "Bio-Cost." |
| **21** | Quantum Bio | Coordinate "Thinking" pulses to align with the user's Ultradian focus peaks. |
