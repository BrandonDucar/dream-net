# 🧬 Briefing: DNA Data Storage (QL-33)

**Source**: Twist Bioscience, Microsoft, Catalog DNA.
**Core Tech**: Encoding binary data (0/1) into base pairs (A/C/T/G).

## The Discovery

DNA is nature's hard drive. It has a theoretical density limit of 215 Petabytes per gram. It lasts 100,000+ years if kept cool. It never goes obsolete (we will always have DNA readers).

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Atlas Data Storage**: Twist's spin-off aiming for Terabyte-scale chips by 2026.
- **Cost**: Dropping rapidly ($1k/GB -> $100/GB). Still expensive for "Hot" data, perfect for "Cold" vaults.
- **Form Factor**: "Liquid Hard Drives" or DNA-on-chip.

## Key Players

1. **Twist Bioscience**: The writing (synthesis) engine.
2. **Microsoft/UW**: The encoding/retrieving algorithms.
3. **Catalog**: Using "DNA movable type" (optimizing liquidity).

**Sovereign Implications**: We can store the *entirety* of DreamNet's history, model weights, and blueprints in a single test tube. It is the ultimate "Backup against the Apocalypse."
