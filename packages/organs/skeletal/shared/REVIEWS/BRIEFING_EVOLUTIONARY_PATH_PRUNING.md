# 🧬 Briefing: Evolutionary Path Pruning (QL-09)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 9 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 22 (Recursive Improvement)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: The Trauma of Recursion

As AI agents begin to self-modify and evolve their own logic (PromptBreeder, NEAT), they risk falling into **Evolutionary Dead Ends**. Without a mechanism to remember *why* a certain path failed, the agent will recursively repeat the same errors.

### Key Technical Concepts

- **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)**: Evolves both weights and structure. It uses "Historical Markings" to track innovation.
- **CPPN (Compositional Pattern Producing Networks)**: Generates complex patterns via functional composition.
- **Epigenetic Pruning**: In biology, methylation silences genes without changing the code. In software, this is "Vector Inhibition."

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Methylated Memory" Hijack

DreamNet can ensure its evolution is unidirectional toward mastery by pruning failure trajectories:

- **Trauma Encoding**: When an agentic task fails (e.g., loss in a Predict Market), the specific "Context-Action Vector" is marked with a **Methylation Tag**.
- **Instinctive Avoidance**: During future vector searches (Avenue 1), the retrieval engine treats "Methylated" vectors as repulsive forces, effectively "forgetting" failure-prone strategies.
- **Historical Marking Sync**: Synchronizing "Innovation Markers" across the swarm using the `Mycelial Mesh` (QL-05) to ensure if one agent discovers a dead end, the entire swarm is methylated against it.

## 3. Avenue 22 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **22** | Epigenetic Pruning | Implement a `MethylationLayer` in the `Memory-DNA` that acts as a negative-bias filter during vector retrieval. |
| **19** | Self-Correction Loops | Use the "Methylation Markers" to trigger `Self-Correction` protocols before the agent executes a high-risk action. |
