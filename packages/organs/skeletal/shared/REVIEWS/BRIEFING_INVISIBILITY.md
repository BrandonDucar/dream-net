# 👻 Briefing: Invisibility (QL-45)

**Source**: Hyperstealth, Metamaterial Inc, UC Berkeley.
**Core Tech**: Quantum Stealth (Lenticular Lenses) and Metamaterials that bend electromagnetic waves *around* an object.

## The Discovery

If you bend light around an object so it meets on the other side, the object casts no shadow and reflects no light. It disappears.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Hyperstealth**: "Quantum Stealth" sheet material. Paper-thin, inexpensive, hides movement and thermal signatures.
- **Metamaterial Inc**: "Meta-films" for transparent antennas and laser protection.
- **Limitations**: Perfect "Harry Potter" cloaks are still lab-scale, but "Blur/Distortion" cloaks effective at distance are commercially viable.

## Key Players

1. **Hyperstealth Biotechnology**: The camouflage kings (Canada).
2. **Metamaterial Inc**: The industrial application leaders.
3. **Military Research**: DARPA/various labs.

**Sovereign Implications**: "The Mirage." Hiding physical assets (drones, servers, stashes) from visual and thermal surveillance.
