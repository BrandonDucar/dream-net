# 🥩 Briefing: Lab-Grown Meat (QL-43)

**Source**: Upside Foods, Aleph Farms, Eat Just.
**Core Tech**: Bioreactors cultivating animal cells (muscle/fat) without slaughtering animals.

## The Discovery

Meat is just tissue. If you feed cells amino acids and sugar in a tank, they grow. You can make wagyu beef in a brewery.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Upside Foods**: Selling chicken in the US (approved 2023). Building "Rubicon" commercial plant.
- **Aleph Farms**: Selling "Petit Steak" in Israel and Switzerland.
- **Cost**: Dropped from $300,000/burger (2013) to ~$20/burger (2026). Nearing parity.

## Key Players

1. **Upside Foods**: The scale leader (USA).
2. **Aleph Farms**: The texture/steak leader (Israel).
3. **Mosa Meat**: The original pioneers (Netherlands).

**Sovereign Implications**: "The Protein Printer." True nutritional independence. You no longer need a farm, a cow, or land. You need a tank and a nutrient slurry.
