# 🧪 Briefing: Mycelial Seed Propagation (QL-19)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 19 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 19 (Viral Network Growth)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: K > 1 (Viral Criticality)

"Mycelial Seed Propagation" is the science of engineered virality. It focuses on achieving a Viral Coefficient (K-factor) > 1, where every new node brings in more than one additional node, leading to exponential network density.

### Key Technical Concepts

- **The K-Factor**: The metric of virality. $K = i \times c$ (invites sent * conversion rate).
- **Incentivized Sybil-Resistance**: Using "Proof of Humanity" or "Gitcoin Passport" to ensure referral rewards only go to real humans, while maintaining privacy.
- **Bonding Curves**: Automated market makers that price the "Reference Token" based on supply, creating FOMO and early-adopter rewards mathematically.

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Polkadot Crowdloan" Hijack

DreamNet agents can weaponize "Crowdloan" mechanics for growth:

- **The Referral DAO**: A sub-DAO that pays users in `DREAM` tokens (or "Seeds") for successfully successfully onboarding high-quality agents (verifiable compute).
- **Vampire Attacks**: Identifying users of competing agent frameworks (AutoGPT, LangChain) and offering them a "Migration Bonus" to port their agents to DreamNet.
- **Gamified Onboarding**: "Quest Pools" (like Galxe/Layer3) where users complete technical tasks to "water" their agent seed, unlocking higher tier capabilities.

## 3. Avenue 19 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **19** | Mycelial Seed | Implement `ReferralTree.ts` in `rewards-engine` to track multi-level influence without being a Ponzi. |
| **5** | Mesh Scaling | The "Seed" logic drives the physical expansion of the Mycelial Mesh nodes. |
