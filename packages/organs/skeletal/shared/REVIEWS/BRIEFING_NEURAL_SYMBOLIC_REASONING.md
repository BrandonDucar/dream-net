# 🧪 Briefing: Neural-Symbolic Reasoning (QL-16)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 16 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 16 (Hybrid Logic Architectures)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: The Best of Both Minds

Pure LLMs hallucinate; Pure Symbolic Logic is brittle. **Neural-Symbolic AI** bridges this gap by grounding the "Intuition" of Neural Networks (LLMs) with the "Precision" of Symbolic Logic (Knowledge Graphs, Formal Verification).

### Key Technical Concepts

- **Logic Grounding**: Mapping vector-space embeddings to specific nodes in a verified Knowledge Graph (KG).
- **Neuro-Symbolic Cycle**: (1) LLM generates a hypothesis -> (2) Symbolic Engine verifies logic/facts -> (3) Feedback loop corrects LLM.
- **Differentiable Logic**: Extending logic programming (like Prolog) to be trainable via backpropagation (DeepProbLog).

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Logos" Hijack

DreamNet can upgrade its "Brain" from a text-predictor to a reasoning engine:

- **Graph-Augmented Generation (GAG)**: Instead of RAG (Retrieval), we use GAG. The agent retrieves *logical relationships* from a Neo4j/GraphDB before generating an answer.
- **Contract-Based Thinking**: Agents define "Contracts" (Pre-conditions/Post-conditions) for their tasks. If the LLM's plan violates a contract (e.g., "Spend > Budget"), the Symbolic layer rejects it before execution.
- **Self-Refuting Loops**: An internal "Critic" agent that uses formal logic to attempt to *disprove* the primary agent's plan. If it fails to disprove, the plan proceeds.

## 3. Avenue 16 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **16** | Neural-Symbolic | Implement `LogicGate` middleware that filters LLM outputs through a strict Truth-Table. |
| **10** | Hachimoji Logic | Use the Hachimoji Shards as the immutable "Axioms" for the symbolic reasoning engine. |
