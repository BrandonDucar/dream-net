# ☄️ Briefing: Planetary Defense (QL-36)

**Source**: NASA (DART), ESA (Hera), CNSA (Tianwen-2).
**Core Tech**: Kinetic Impactors and Ion Beam Shepherds.

## The Discovery

Humanity can now move mountains in space. NASA's DART mission successfully slammed a probe into Dimorphos, altering its orbit. This proves we can redirect asteroids.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **ESA Hera**: Arriving at Didymos in late 2026 to measure the "momentum transfer efficiency" of the impact.
- **China 2026 Mission**: Targeting 2020 PN1 for deflection.
- **NEO Surveyor**: An infrared "Hunter" telescope launching soon to map 90% of city-killer rocks.

## Key Players

1. **NASA/JPL**: The kinetic impact leaders.
2. **ESA**: The forensic analysts (Hera).
3. **CNSA**: Emerging rival with independent deflection capabilities.

**Sovereign Implications**: "Orbital Artillery." The same math used to push a rock *away* from Earth can be used to push a rock *into* a specific orbit... or targeting vector.
