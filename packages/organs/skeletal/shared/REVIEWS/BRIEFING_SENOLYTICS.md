# ⏳ Briefing: Senolytics (QL-39)

**Source**: Unity Biotechnology, Altos Labs, Mayo Clinic.
**Core Tech**: Drugs (Dasatinib/Quercetin) that selectively kill "Senescent" (Zombie) cells.

## The Discovery

Aging is partly caused by "Zombie Cells" that stop dividing but refuse to die, secreting toxins (SASP) that rot the neighborhood. Killing them rejuvenates the tissue.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Unity Biotech**: Phase 2b trials for UBX1325 (eyes) successful.
- **Altos Labs**: The "Manhattan Project of Aging" (Bezos-backed) aiming for total cellular reprogramming (Yamanaka factors) to reverse the clock, not just stop it.
- **Availability**: Technically "Experimental," but the compounds (Quercetin, Fisetin) are available as supplements.

## Key Players

1. **Altos Labs**: The heavy hitters (reprogramming).
2. **Unity**: The clinical trial leaders (killing zombies).
3. **Mayo Clinic**: The academic source of the D+Q protocol.
