# 🧶 Briefing: Space Tethers (QL-41)

**Source**: SpinLaunch, Star Catcher, Tethers Unlimited.
**Core Tech**: Kinetic Launch Systems (Centrifuges) or Rotating Skyhooks to fling payloads into orbit without rockets.

## The Discovery

Rockets are inefficient (90% fuel). Spinning a payload in a vacuum chamber to Mach 6 and releasing it (SpinLaunch) or catching it with a rotating hook in orbit (Skyhook) reduces launch costs by 10-100x.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **SpinLaunch**: Conducting regular suborbital tests at Spaceport America. Orbital accelerator construction begins 2026.
- **Star Catcher**: Proposed energy network, but foundational tether tech is maturing.
- **Cost**: Targeting $200/kg (vs $1500/kg for Falcon 9).

## Key Players

1. **SpinLaunch**: The kinetic launch leader.
2. **Tethers Unlimited**: The orbital mechanics experts.
3. **Nasa Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC)**: Funding various "non-rocket" studies.

**Sovereign Implications**: "The Catapult." If you can launch small payloads (sensors, seeds, backups) for the price of a used car, you don't need a space program; you just need a ticket.
