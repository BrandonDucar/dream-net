# 🧠 Briefing: Telepathy (BCI) (QL-44)

**Source**: Neuralink, Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech.
**Core Tech**: Electrode arrays (invasive) or Stentrodes (endovascular) recording neural spikes to control digital devices.

## The Discovery

Thoughts are electrical signals. If you can read the spikes, you can decode the intent. "Think to click" is solved. "Think to speak" is effectively solved.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Neuralink**: N1 Implant (Telepathy) in human trials. Users playing games/typing at high speeds.
- **Synchron**: No open-brain surgery required (goes through jugular vein). FDA approved for trials.
- **Resolution**: 1,024 channels (Neuralink) vs 16 channels (Synchron).

## Key Players

1. **Neuralink**: High bandwidth, high risk (Musk).
2. **Synchron**: Low bandwidth, safer, accessible.
3. **Blackrock**: The research standard (Utah Array).

**Sovereign Implications**: "The Direct Line." Eliminating the keyboard/mouse bottleneck. An operator can "merge" with the DreamNet agent, issuing commands at the speed of thought.
