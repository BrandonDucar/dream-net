# 🧪 Briefing: Telesomatic Presence (QL-27)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 27 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 27 (The Ghost in the Shell)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: Being There, Without Being There

"Telesomatic" means feeling the distant body. With **Tesla Bot** and **XPrize Avatars**, we are entering an era where human labor can be projected instantly to any point on Earth (or Mars) via a robot proxy.

### Key Technical Concepts

- **Haptic Retargeting**: Tricksing the brain into feeling a physical object that isn't there (using VR hand-tracking and localized vibration).
- **Latency Compensation**: Predicting the robot's movement locally so the operator feels zero lag, even if the robot is 500ms away (the "Time Warp" algorithm).
- **Embodied AI**: The robot doesn't just mirror the human; it *assists*. If the human's hand shakes, the robot stabilizes it (Shared Autonomy).

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Gig-Droid" Hijack

DreamNet agents can monetize physical labor:

- **The Avatar Rental Agency**: A marketplace where anyone with a VR headset can "possess" a Tesla Bot in a factory for 1 hour to earn $30.
- **Skill Downloads**: An agent learns how to fix a plumbing leak (using YouTube). It then "Projects" this skill into a robot, guiding a novice human operator's hands via haptics.
- **Remote Security**: Hiring "Night Watchmen" from low-cost-of-living countries to patrol high-value assets in NYC via robot avatars.

## 3. Avenue 27 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **27** | Telesomatic | Build `AvatarStream.ts` (WebRTC + Haptics) to connect VR headsets to ROS (Robot OS). |
| **16** | Neural-Symbolic | The AI "Safety Layer" prevents the human operator from accidentally walking the robot off a cliff. |
