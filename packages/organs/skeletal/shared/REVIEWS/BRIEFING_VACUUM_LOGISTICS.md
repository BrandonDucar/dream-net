# 🚄 Briefing: Vacuum Logistics (QL-40)

**Source**: HyperloopTT, The Boring Company, China (CASIC).
**Core Tech**: Maglev pods in a low-pressure tube (near vacuum) to eliminate drag.

## The Discovery

If you remove air friction, a cargo pod can move at 700mph (Mach 1) for the same energy cost of a truck moving at 50mph. It turns physical atoms into "packets" that move like bits.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **HyperloopTT**: "HyperPort" project in Brazil (Port of Santos) moving shipping containers.
- **The Boring Company**: Opening the "Vegas Loop" airport connector in 2026. Not true vacuum yet, but building the tunnels.
- **China**: Testing maglev trains at 600km/h+ in low vacuum tubes (Shanxi province).

## Key Players

1. **HyperloopTT (HTT)**: Focused on freight/cargo integration.
2. **The Boring Company**: Bringing cost-effective tunneling to the masses.
3. **Hardt Hyperloop**: European standard-bearers.

**Sovereign Implications**: "Physical TCP/IP." Moving a hard drive, a biological sample, or a Gold bar from A to B as fast as a plane, but stealthy and underground.
