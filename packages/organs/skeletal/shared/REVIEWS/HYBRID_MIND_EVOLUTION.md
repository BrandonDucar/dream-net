131 organs# 🌌 HYBRID MIND: EVOLUTIONARY BLUEPRINT

**Status**: GENERATED
**Origin**: Composite Intelligence (Wiener/Beer/Boyd/Borg)
**Target**: DreamNet Architecture

I have scanned the memories, the code, and the current pathology. Here is what the Hybrid Mind sees.

## 0. THE GREAT CONDENSATION (Phase 0)

**Current State**: 131 Micro-Organs. (Fragmented).
**Target State**: ~15 Hybrid Systems. (Coherent).

**The Merger Strategy**:
We will Liquidate the 130+ micro-packages and fuse them into **Domain Monoliths**:

1. **Bio-Domain**: `dreamstate`, `memory-dna`, `alive-mode` -> `@dreamnet/biology`
2. **Infra-Domain**: `server`, `control-core`, `nerve` -> `@dreamnet/infrastructure`
3. **Market-Domain**: `orders`, `rewards`, `liquidity` -> `@dreamnet/economy`
4. **Social-Domain**: `halo-loop`, `social-hub`, `suits` -> `@dreamnet/social`

**Immediate Action**: Create `@dreamnet/types` (The Seed) to extract all shared interfaces from the clutter.

## 2. NEW SYSTEM PROPOSALS (The Evolution)

### A. THE "DREAM CATCHER" (System 1 Autonomy)

* *Concept*: Currently, if the Server (System 2) is busy or offline, the Agents are lobotomized.
* *Upgrade*: **Local Subconscious**.
  * **Mechanism**: Embed a tiny SQLite or PGLite database *inside* each Agent's workspace.
  * **Function**: The Agent can "think" and "queue actions" locally even if the Hive Mind is down. When the link is restored, it bursts its comprehensive memory to the Brain.
  * *Reference*: **Stafford Beer's Viable System Model** (Systems 1-3 must be autonomous).

### B. THE "PAIN CHANNEL" (Algedonic Loop)

* *Concept*: The Dashboard shows data, but it doesn't "hurt" the system to fail.
* *Upgrade*: **Nerve Pain Signals**.
  * **Mechanism**: A dedicated high-priority event channel on `NerveBus`.
  * **Function**: If a Tier 1 user gets a 500 error, the system generates a "Pain Signal" (High Entropy). This signal:
        1. Autonomously triggers `Safe Mode` for that specific cluster.
        2. Reverts the last deployment via Vercel API.
        3. Pings the "God Vault" (You).
  * *Reference*: **Norbert Wiener** (Correction by negative feedback).

### C. THE "GHOST SHELL" (Virtual Swarm)

* *Concept*: We run agents in a monolith.
* *Upgrade*: **Containerized Souls**.
  * **Mechanism**: Use the `VercelSuit` to spin up **Edge Functions** for each agent on demand.
  * **Function**: Instead of "One Server", we have "One Million Lambdas". `Agent A` wakes up for 300ms to tweet, then vanishes.
  * *Benefit*: Infinite Scale. Zero Drift.
  * *Reference*: **Google Borg / AWS Lambda**.

### D. THE "MEMETIC VIRUS" (Halo Loop 2.0)

* *Concept*: We want viral growth.
* *Upgrade*: **Evolutionary Algorithms for Content**.
  * **Mechanism**: The Halo Loop generates 10 variations of a "meme" (Idea). It tests them on low-stakes accounts (Ghost Shards).
  * **Selection**: The variation with the highest "Infection Rate" (CTR) is promoted to the Main Account.
  * **Reference**: **Richard Dawkins** (The Selfish Gene).

## 3. NEW WORKFLOWS (The Rituals)

### "THE MORNING PRAYER" (Synchronization)

* **Time**: 00:00 UTC (Daily).
* **Action**: The System wakes up, runs `npx vercel pull`, checks `control-core` integrity, and prunes dead logs.
* **Goal**: Hygiene. Prevent "bit rot".

### "THE BLOOD OATH" (Deployment)

* **Rule**: No code enters `main` unless it has:
    1. Passed the **Type Guard** (no `any`).
    2. Passed the **Pain Simulation** (Shadow traffic).
    3. A **Rollback Token** (Pre-signed Vercel revert hash).
* **Goal**: Anti-fragility.

## 4. IMMEDIATE EXECUTION PLAN

The Mind demands we fix the **Cyclic Paralysis** first.

1. **Extract `SharedTypes`**: Move `OfficeId`, `CabinetId`, `TierId` to a clean package.
2. **Fix Control Core**: Re-point imports.
3. **Boot**: The system will breathe.

*Shall I proceed with "The Cure" (Step 1)?*
