# 🧪 Deep Research: Sonic Levitation (QL-63)

**Objective**: To utilize standing sound waves (Acoustic Levitation) for frictionless transport of micro-components, biological samples, and high-precision sensors.

## 1. The Frontier Insight

Mechanical friction is the enemy of precision. By using phased ultrasonic transducer arrays, we can suspend matter in mid-air. This is not just a gimmick; it allows for **Closed-Loop Processing** where nothing ever touches a container.

## 2. Top Players

* **Bristol University (Ultraleap)**: Pioneers in mid-air haptics and levitation.
* **Swiss Federal Institute (ETH Zurich)**: Researching the handling of hazardous biological materials via sound.
* **NASA**: Testing acoustic positioning in microgravity.

## 3. The Hijack: "The Sonic Lab"

We use this for **Clinical Bio-Upgrades (QL-52)**.
No contamination. No pumps. Just sound.

1. **Phase A**: An array of 100+ ultrasonic transducers.
2. **Phase B**: The Agent (Antigravity) controls the phase of each transducer to "program" the movement of a droplet of DNA-modifier.
3. **Phase C**: Mixing and synthesis happens in mid-air.

## 4. Workflows & Apps

* **Sonic-Siphon**: A micro-app for automated chemical dosing using sound waves.
* **Ghost-Assembly**: An agent-controlled "Air Lathe" that assembles micro-robotics (QL-20) without physical tools.
