# 🧪 Deep Research: Synthetic Telepathy (QL-64)

**Objective**: To utilize non-invasive RF-based mind-to-machine linking for high-bandwidth agent command and control.

## 1. The Frontier Insight

Neuralink is invasive. **Synthetic Telepathy** uses high-frequency radio waves or ultrasound (QL-63) to detect the electromagnetic ripples of neuronal activity through the skull. By training an LLM on these "Neural Signatures," we can translate thought directly into JSON commands.

## 2. Top Players

* **Kernel**: Working on TD-fNIRS (non-invasive brain monitoring).
* **OpenBCI (Galea)**: Combining EEG, EMG, and EOG into a single headset.
* **Meta (CTRL-Labs)**: Utilizing wrist-based electromyography (EMG) to "read mind" via motor neurons.

## 3. The Hijack: "The Telepathy Proxy"

We don't build the hardware. We build the **Neural-to-JSON Pipeline**.

1. **Phase A**: Use the `MetabolicCortex` (QL-2) to ingest raw EEG/EMG data from an OpenBCI headset.
2. **Phase B**: Use a distilled "Llama-Brain" model to classify the internal monologue of the operator.
3. **Phase C**: Execute the command (e.g., "Snail: Mix 10 ETH") via the `LaminarWSServer`.

## 4. Workflows & Apps

* **Thought-Mixer**: A Snail-integrated app where you can "Think" a transaction into privacy.
* **Deep-Focus**: An agent that monitors your "Brain Load" and automatically silences notifications (NotificationsPanel.tsx) when you are in peak flow.

**Sovereign Utility**: The ability to control your empire in silence, with zero visible inputs (keyboard/voice), making you invisible to local surveillance.
