# 🧪 Deep Research: Vacuum Logistics (QL-91)

**Objective**: To utilize vacuum-tube transportation (Hyperloop-style) for friction-less, near-supersonic movement of physical agent hardware and biological samples.

## 1. The Frontier Insight

Physical transport is slow and energy-expensive due to air resistance and friction. By creating a partial vacuum in a tube and using maglev (QL-26) or sonic levitation (QL-63), we can move matter at 1000km/h+ using minimal power.

## 2. Top Players

* **Virgin Hyperloop / DP World**: The main commercial push for cargo hyperloop.
* **Hardt Hyperloop**: European leader in vacuum infrastructure.
* **The Boring Company**: Working on high-speed "Ploop" tunnels.

## 3. The Hijack: "The Sovereign Pipe"

We don't build trans-continental tubes. We build **Micro-Vacs**.
A 10cm diameter vacuum pipe can move a "Skill Atom" (QL-10) or a "Seed Packet" (QL-43) across a city in seconds.

1. **Phase A**: Utilizing abandoned optical fiber conduits or sewer lines (The Under-Miner - QL-92).
2. **Phase B**: Creating a permanent vacuum using low-power pumps (Quantum Archeology - QL-59 energy recovery).
3. **Phase C**: Using **Pulse Sync (QL-41)** to time the arrivals and departures of cargo pods.

## 4. Workflows & Apps

* **Insta-Ship**: A Mini-App for local, high-speed delivery of biological upgrades (The Academy).
* **Hardware-Hunker**: Automatically shunting physical HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) between hidden city-vaults in response to a **Watchtower (QL-02)** alert.

**Sovereign Utility**: Movement of physical assets that is faster than a drone and invisible to the sky.
