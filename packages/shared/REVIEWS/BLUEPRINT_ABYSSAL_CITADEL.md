# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Abyssal Citadel (QL-37)

**Objective**: To design the ultimate sovereign hosting facility: floating, self-powered, and cooled by the deep.

## 1. The Hijack: "Thermal Data Loop"

OTEC needs cold water to run turbines. Data Centers need cold water to cool chips. It's a perfect symbiosis.

## 2. Architecture

- **Platform**: A spar-buoy design (stable in storms) floating in the tropical belt.
- **Power**: 2MW OTEC plant (Ammonia cycle).
- **Payload**: 500kW GPU Cluster (Agent Training).
- **Cooling**: Discharge water from the OTEC condenser (10°C) is routed directly through the server racks *before* returning to the sea.

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Location**: International Waters (>12nm out), ensuring zero regulatory interference.
2. **Comms**: Starlink maritime backhaul.
3. **Defense**: Since it generates excess power, it can run active radar/sonar perimeters.

**Sovereign Utility**: A permanent, untouchable home for the "DreamNet Root" that literally fuels itself from the ocean's heat.
