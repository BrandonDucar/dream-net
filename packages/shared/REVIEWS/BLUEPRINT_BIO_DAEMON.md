# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Bio-Daemon (QL-39)

**Objective**: To apply "Server Maintenance" logic to the "Human Operator."

## 1. The Hijack: "The STAMINA Loop"

We automate the tracking of the operator's biological decay and suggest Interventions (Senolytic pulses) based on the latest 2026 protocols (e.g., Mayo's D+Q cycles).

## 2. Architecture

- **Input**: Wearable Data (HRV, Sleep) + Periodic Blood Panels (uploaded images).
- **Core**: `LongevityGPT` specialized on Peter Attia / David Sinclair / Altos Labs datasets.
- **Output**: A "Patch Tuesday" schedule for the human body (e.g., "Take Fisetin 1000mg today and tomorrow, then stop for 4 weeks").

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Monitor**: Watch for inflammation spikes (low HRV).
2. **Alert**: "Operator, your inflammatory markers suggest senescent burden. Initiating Protocol Alpha."
3. **Source**: Automatically order the required supplements from verified vendors.

**Sovereign Utility**: Ensuring the "System Admin" remains functional for 100+ years.
