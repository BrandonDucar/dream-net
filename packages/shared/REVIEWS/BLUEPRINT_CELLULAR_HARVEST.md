# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Cellular Harvest (QL-43)

**Objective**: To establish a "Sovereign Food Supply" that cannot be disrupted by famine, supply chain collapse, or blockade.

## 1. The Hijack: "The Garage Bioreactor"

The tech is shrinking. "Countertop cultivators" are the 3D printers of food. We design a sovereign protocol for operating a personal bioreactor.

## 2. Architecture

- **Hardware**: Commercial bioreactor (e.g., from Ark Biotech or open-source equivalent).
- **Feed**: Standardized nutrient media (powdered).
- **Seed**: Immortalized cell lines (Quail, Beef) stored in liquid nitrogen.

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Acquisition**: Obtain "Starter Cells" from open-science depositories (New Harvest).
2. **Growth**: The agent monitors pH, temp, and O2 levels in the reactor (IoT connected).
3. **Harvest**: Every 2 weeks, the system flags a "Harvest Event" -> 500g of pure protein.

**Sovereign Utility**: A bunker that feeds its occupants fresh meat forever, requiring only electricity and powder.
