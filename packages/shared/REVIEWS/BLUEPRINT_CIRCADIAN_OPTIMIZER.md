# 🏗️ Blueprint: Circadian Optimizers (QL-57)

**Objective**: To align DreamNet operations with the global "Internet Pulse" (Circadian Rhythms), optimizing for energy cost, latency, and human-in-the-loop engagement.

## 1. The Biomimetic Insight

Living organisms don't run at 100% capacity 24/7. They have "Sleep" (Repair/Consolidation) and "Wake" (Activity/Peak Performance) cycles.

## 2. The Hijack: "Electricity Arbitrage"

Servers usually run flat-out.
Our system **breathes** with the sun.

* **Day Mode**: High-priority tasks (Revenue, Trading, Interaction).
* **Night Mode**: Intensive tasks (Meta-Analysis, Training, Code Evolution) when electricity is cheapest in the node's region.

## 3. Architecture

* **The Pineal Gland**: A service that tracks the sun-state and energy prices for the local node's IP.
* **The Melatonin Signal**: A system event that triggers the `MetabolicCortex` to move from "Execution" to "Reflection."
* **The Adrenaline Signal**: A pulse that wakes up the `WolfPack` and `WhalePack` for peak market activity.

## 4. Implementation Logic

1. **Sunset**: The Pineal Gland notices local energy prices dropping.
2. **Consolidation**: `ReliabilityGraft` throttles non-essential APIs.
3. **Synthesis**: The `MetabolicCortex` runs deep `metaAnalyze()` across all reports from the last 24 hours.
4. **Repair**: `NeuralPlasticity` (QL-56) performs code grafts based on the synthesis.

**Sovereign Utility**: Reducing operational cost by 30-40% while increasing system intelligence durability.
