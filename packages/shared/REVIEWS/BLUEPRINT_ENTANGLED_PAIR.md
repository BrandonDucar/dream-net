# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Entangled Pair (QL-49)

**Objective**: To establish a single, unbreakable link for the "Crown Jewels" (Master Private Keys).

## 1. The Hijack: "Dark Fiber QKD"

We don't need a whole internet. We just need one link between the Operator and the Core. We lease "Dark Fiber" (unused optical cable) and attach commercial QKD appliances to the ends.

## 2. Architecture

- **Hardware**: Toshiba QKD System (multiplexed on standard fiber).
- **Medium**: Leased Dark Fiber strand (up to 100km).
- **Protocol**: BB84 or E91 protocol.

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Setup**: End A (Home), End B (Data Center).
2. **Exchange**: The system continuously generates a "One-Time Pad" using quantum states.
3. **Encryption**: The actual data is encrypted with this infinite, uncrackable pad.

**Sovereign Utility**: The Red Phone. Perfect secrecy.
