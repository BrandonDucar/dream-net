# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Mirage Cloak (QL-45)

**Objective**: To apply passive optical camouflage to Sovereign Assets (Drone Hives, Server Buoys).

## 1. The Hijack: "Lenticular Shielding"

We utilize commercially available "Lenticular" sheets (like those used in 3D posters, but optimized for stealth) to scramble the visual signature of static assets.

## 2. Architecture

- **Material**: Hyperstealth-style Lenticular sheets (broadband light bending).
- **Target**: The "Abyssal Citadel" buoy or "Aether Factory" container.
- **Spectrum**: Visual + Thermal (IR).

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Wrap**: Encase the asset in a faceted shell of lenticular material.
2. **Background**: The material bends light from the *background* (e.g., ocean waves, forest) around the object.
3. **Result**: From >50m away, the object is indistinguishable from the background noise.

**Sovereign Utility**: "Security through Physics." No power required. It works even if the batteries die. It just disappears.
