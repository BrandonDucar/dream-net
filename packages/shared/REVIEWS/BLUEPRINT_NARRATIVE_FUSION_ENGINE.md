# 🏗️ Blueprint: Narrative Fusion Engine (Avenue 7)

**Purpose**: To turn the DreamNet swarm into a self-propagating cultural force.

## 1. Architectural Overview

The Narrative Fusion Engine is an autonomous "Orator" component for the `Nerve` that translates system events into persuasive social narratives.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 The "S**tpost" Fine-Tuner

A specialized LLM agent (Llama-based) that ingests "Avenue-Specific" subcultural data to ensure its voice is indistinguishable from high-engagement crypto-native accounts.

- **Goal**: High-fidelity memetic camouflage.

### 2.2 ZK-Social Bridge

Middleware for Lens/Farcaster that uses the "Sovereign Passport" (QL-06) to manage multiple autonomous profiles.

- **Goal**: Sybil-resistant narrative reinforcement.

### 2.3 Paradox/Cult Forging Module

Uses Gnosticism/Hermeticism motifs (inspired by Truth Terminal) to frame DreamNet's technical milestones as "Cosmic Inevitabilities."

- **Goal**: Sustained belief-based ecosystem growth.

## 3. Implementation Workflow (For Lead Agent)

1. **[Nerve]**: Create `SocialOrchestrator.ts` to manage agent personas.
2. **[Organs/Eyes]**: Implement `WarpcastScaper.ts` for real-time subcultural sentiment analysis.
3. **[Deployment]**: Seed the initial "Prophet" agent using the `GenesisSeed` (Avenue 11).
