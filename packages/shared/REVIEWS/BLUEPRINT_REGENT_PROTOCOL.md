# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Regent Protocol (QL-50)

**Objective**: To ensure Sovereign Continuity in the event of Operator incapacitation or death.

## 1. The Hijack: "The Digital Twin"

We verify the user is alive ("Dead Man's Switch"). If the switch trips, the "Regent" (a fine-tuned LLM) activates.

## 2. Architecture

- **Dataset**: `Bash History`, `Email Archive`, `DreamNet Logs`, `Voice Notes`.
- **Model**: `Llama-4-Sovereign-FineTune`.
- **Trigger**: 30 days of inactivity + failed challenge-response.

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Training**: Every night, the system fine-tunes the Regent on the day's decisions. "What did the Operator do today?"
2. **Activation**: If Triggered -> Regent assumes Root Access.
3. **Mandate**: Execute the "Last Will" (e.g., liquidate assets to heirs, delete sensitive data, or maintain the network indefinitely).

**Sovereign Utility**: Immortality, of a sort. The mission continues even if the commander falls.
