# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Star Jar (QL-42)

**Objective**: To secure "First Production" rights to fusion energy for DreamNet's compute clusters.

## 1. The Hijack: "The Microsoft PPA Model"

Microsoft bought Helion's first 50MW before it existed. We can't buy 50MW, but we can aggregate demand via a DAO to buy a "Sliver" of the first reactor's output.

## 2. Architecture

- **Instrument**: A "Fusion Future" token representing 1kWh of Helion/CFS production.
- **Collateral**: Staked ETH to guarantee purchase.
- **Target**: Helion's 2028 commercial rollout.

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Arbitrage**: Current energy = $0.10/kWh. Fusion early adopter price = Premium. But "Green + Baseload" is priceless for AI data centers.
2. **Contract**: Smart contract that executes a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) automatically upon "Net Energy Verified" signal.
3. **Co-Location**: Build the Sovereign Server *next door* to the fusion plant to eliminate transmission loss.

**Sovereign Utility**: Compute that runs on starlight, independent of the national grid's decay.
