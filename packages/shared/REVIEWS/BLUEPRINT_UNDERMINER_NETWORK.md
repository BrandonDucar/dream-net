# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Underminer Network (QL-40)

**Objective**: To utilize subterranean vacuum/tunnel networks for the covert movement of Sovereign Assets.

## 1. The Hijack: "The Last Mile Loop"

We can't build a Hyperloop. But we can utilize the emerging **Urban Loops** (Boring Company) as a "Physical VPN."

## 2. Architecture

- **Vehicle**: Autonomous Pods (Tesla chassis) running in the TBC tunnels.
- **Payload**: "Secure Enclaves" (armored lockboxes) inside the pods.
- **Network**: The Vegas/Dubai Loops (opening 2026).

## 3. Implementation Logic

1. **Injection**: Sovereign assets (cold storage drives, cash, samples) are loaded into a pod at a "Public" station (e.g., Airport).
2. **Routing**: The pod is routed through the tunnel network to a "Private" spur (e.g., a secure warehouse basement).
3. **Speed**: The transfer happens at 150mph underground, immune to traffic, police scanners, or aerial surveillance.

**Sovereign Utility**: A subway system for secrets.
