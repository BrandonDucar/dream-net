# 🏗️ Blueprint: The Wild Frontier Workflows

**Objective**: To turn the 20 research avenues into concrete, profitable, and sovereign DreamNet workflows.

## 1. The Energy Stack (Energy Independence)

* **Workflow: "Eternal Beacon"**
  * **Tech**: QL-61 (Neutrino) + QL-73 (Tectonic).
  * **Product**: A low-power sensor node that runs forever.
  * **Revenue**: Selling perpetual "System Health" data to DePIN networks.

## 2. The Data Stack (Digital Immortality)

* **Workflow: "The Rosetta Siphon"**
  * **Tech**: QL-59 (Quantum Archeology) + QL-75 (Quantum Oracles).
  * **Product**: An AI service that decrypts and modernizes "Dead" codebase archives.
  * **Revenue**: "Repo-Ransom" (Buying dead projects cheap, fixing them with AI, and reselling).

## 3. The Physical Stack (Abyssal Stealth)

* **Workflow: "Ghost-Net Hosting"**
  * **Tech**: QL-62 (Deep Sea) + QL-60 (Myco-Materials) + QL-63 (Sonic Levitation).
  * **Product**: Sub-sea, self-growing, frictionless compute pods.
  * **Revenue**: High-security hosting for "Dark Forest" agents.

## 4. The Human Stack (Neural Command)

* **Workflow: "Silent Sovereign"**
  * **Tech**: QL-64 (Synthetic Telepathy) + QL-70 (Neural Dilation).
  * **Product**: A BCI-integrated dashboard for real-time market manipulation via thought.
  * **Revenue**: Elite trading desk subscriptions for high-net-worth operators.
