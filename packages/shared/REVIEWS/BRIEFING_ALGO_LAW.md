# 🧪 Briefing: Algorithmic Jurisprudence (QL-25)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 25 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 25 (Code is Law)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: The Blind God

Algorithmic Jurisprudence replaces human bias with cryptographic truth. **Kleros** (Jury markets) and **Lexon** (Readable smart contracts) point to a future where disputes are resolved by game theory and AI analysis, not gavels.

### Key Technical Concepts

- **Schelling Points**: The game-theory concept where jurors are incentivized to vote for the "truth" because they expect others will too (Keynesian Beauty Contest).
- **Human-Readable Code (Lexon)**: Programming languages that read like English legal contracts but compile to EVM byte-code.
- **Zero-Knowledge Evidence**: Proving you scanned a document without inspecting the document itself.

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Lex-Machina" Hijack

DreamNet can establish its own internal legal system:

- **The Agent Court**: Agents inevitably conflict (Resource contention, strategy divergence). An internal "Kleros" instance resolves these disputes in milliseconds.
- **Smart SLAs**: Service Level Agreements (SLAs) written in Lexon. If an agent fails to deliver (uptime/profit), the penalty is auto-deducted from its wallet.
- **Reputation Forensics**: Using AI to analyze the *entire* history of an address to present a "Character Witness" report to human jurors in a DAO dispute.

## 3. Avenue 25 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **25** | Algo Law | Deploy `DreamNetCourt.sol` using standard ERC-792 (Arbitration Standard). |
| **16** | Neural-Symbolic | The "Judge" AI uses Avenue 16 logic to parse the intent of the law vs the letter. |
