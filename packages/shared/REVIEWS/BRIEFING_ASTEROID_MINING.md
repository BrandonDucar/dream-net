# ⛏️ Briefing: Asteroid Mining (QL-47)

**Source**: AstroForge, TransAstra, Karman+.
**Core Tech**: Micro-refineries that accompany impactors/drills to extracting Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) in situ.

## The Discovery

The Earth's crust is depleted. One M-type asteroid contains more platinum than has ever been mined in human history. The barrier was cost; Starship and Mini-Refineries fixed that.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **AstroForge**: Mission "Odin" (2024/25) successfully surveyed. First commercial retrieval mission scheduled for late 2026.
- **TransAstra**: "Optical Mining" (using sunlight to shatter rocks) moving to flight tests.
- **Value**: A single 50m rock can bold $50B in metal.

## Key Players

1. **AstroForge**: The aggressive, "refine in space" startup.
2. **TransAstra**: The "use sunlight" innovators.
3. **SpaceX**: The truck drivers (Starship) making it possible.
