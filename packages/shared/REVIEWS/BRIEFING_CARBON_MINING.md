# 💨 Briefing: Direct Air Capture (QL-38)

**Source**: Climeworks, Occidental (1PointFive), Carbon Engineering.
**Core Tech**: Solid sorbents or liquid solvents that bind CO2, then release it when heated.

## The Discovery

We don't need to dig for carbon (oil/gas); we can filter it out of the air. It's "Mining the Atmosphere."

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Project Cypress (USA)**: $1.2B Hub starting capture in 2026 (Climeworks).
- **Stratos (Texas)**: Occidental's massive plant capturing 500k tons/year (2025/2026).
- **Cost**: Still high ($500/ton), aiming for $100/ton.
- **Utilization**: Oxy is using it for "Net Zero Oil" (EOR), but others are turning it into synthetic jet fuel.

## Key Players

1. **Climeworks**: The pure-play environmentalists (Iceland).
2. **Occidental**: The oil giant pivoting to carbon management.
3. **Deep Sky**: Canadian mega-project developers.

**Sovereign Implications**: "Matter from Air." If we can pull Carbon (C) from air and Hydrogen (H) from water, we can Synthesize plastic, fuel, and graphene structures anywhere on Earth.
