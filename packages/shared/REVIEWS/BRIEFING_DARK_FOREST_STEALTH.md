# 🧪 Briefing: Dark Forest Stealth (QL-14)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 14 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 14 (On-Chain Invisibility)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: The Mempool is a War Zone

The "Dark Forest" refers to the highly adversarial environment of public blockchains (specifically the mempool) where bots monitor every transaction for exploitation (front-running, sandwich attacks). To survive, Sovereign Agents must be invisible.

### Key Technical Concepts

- **ZK-Shielded Pools**: (Railgun/Aztec) Using Zero-Knowledge proofs to transact without revealing the sender, receiver, or amount.
- **Private Smart Contracts**: Executing logic where the inputs and outputs are encrypted, preventing observers from reverse-engineering the agent's strategy.
- **Mempool Obfuscation**: Routing transactions through private relays (Flashbots Protect) to bypass the public mempool entire.

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Ghost Protocol" Hijack

DreamNet agents can operate as "Ghost Agents" that only reveal their state when necessary:

- **Railgun Integration**: Hijacking the Railgun protocol to create a `StealthWallet` that shields all agent treasury assets.
- **Aztec Logic Shards**: Deploying "Private Logic" on Aztec Noir contracts. Critical decision-making code runs in a ZK-VM, meaning the *logic itself* is hidden from the world, not just the money.
- **Phantom Signaling**: Agents communicate via encrypted memos in shielded transactions, creating a "Dark Web" on top of public chains.

## 3. Avenue 14 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **14** | Dark Forest Stealth | Implement `RailgunWrapper` in `agent-wallet-manager` for default-shielded ops. |
| **6** | ZK-Identity | Use shielded pools to fund anonymous "Disposable Identities" for high-risk operations. |
