# 👻 Briefing: Digital Afterlife (QL-50)

**Source**: Nectome, Somnium Space, Replika, Microsoft Research (VALL-E).
**Core Tech**: "Preservation" (Aldehyde-stabilized cryopreservation) or "Emulation" (Training a model on a life's worth of data).

## The Discovery

You generate terabytes of data: logs, chats, voice, video. That is enough to train a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) that speaks, thinks, and decides *exactly* like you.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Live Forever Mode (Somnium)**: VR avatars powered by AI trained on your movement and speech.
- **HereAfter AI**: Interactive memory biographies.
- **Nectome**: The "backup" option (fatal, preserving the connectome). Paused/Controversial.

## Key Players

1. **Somnium Space**: The VR implementation.
2. **Replika**: The emotional emulation.
3. **Microsoft**: The voice cloning (VALL-E 2).

**Sovereign Implications**: "The Ghost in the Shell." If the Operator dies, the system must not fail. A "Regent AI," trained on the Operator's decision patterns, takes command to execute the will/trust.
