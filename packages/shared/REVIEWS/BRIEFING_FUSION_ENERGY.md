# ☀️ Briefing: Fusion Energy (QL-42)

**Source**: Helion, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), ITER.
**Core Tech**: Magnetic Confinement (Tokamak) or Magneto-Inertial Fusion to fuse deuterium/tritium.

## The Discovery

Smashing atoms together creates more energy than it consumes (Ignition). LLNL achieved this in 2022. Now commercial startups are racing to put it on the grid.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Helion**: Project "Polaris" aims to demonstrate electricity generation by 2026. Microsoft has already signed a PPA for 2028.
- **CFS**: SPARC reactor (MIT) achieving net energy plasma in 2026.
- **Fuel**: Deuterium (from water) + Helium-3 (from Helion's process).

## Key Players

1. **Helion Energy**: The compact, pulsed fusion leader (Sam Altman backed).
2. **Commonwealth Fusion Systems**: The high-field magnet leader (Bill Gates backed).
3. **General Fusion**: The acoustic compression underdog.

**Sovereign Implications**: "The Star Jar." A power source that doesn't rely on the sun shining, the wind blowing, or the Saudis drilling. It is the end of scarcity.
