# 🧬 Briefing: Generative Biology (QL-46)

**Source**: EvolutionaryScale (ESM3), DeepMind (AlphaFold 3), Ginkgo Bioworks.
**Core Tech**: LLMs trained on 3.5 billion years of evolutionary data to "predict" and "generate" new proteins, enzymes, and organisms that never existed in nature.

## The Discovery

Biology is just a language (A/C/T/G). If you train a Transformer on it, you can prompt it: "Generate a protein that eats Polyethylene plastic and glows green when finished."

## The State of Art (2026)

- **ESM3 (Evolutionary Scale)**: A multimodal model that generates sequence, structure, and function simultaneously.
- **AlphaFold 3**: Predicts interactions between proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands with atomic accuracy.
- **Ginkgo**: The "foundry" that prints the generated code into yeast cells.

## Key Players

1. **EvolutionaryScale**: The "OpenAI of Biology" (founded by former Meta FAIR researchers).
2. **Google DeepMind**: The structure prediction kings.
3. **Ginkgo Bioworks**: The manufacturing layer.

**Sovereign Implications**: "The Life Compiler." You are no longer limited to the tools evolution gave us. You can compile a biological tool for *any* problem (waste, fuel, medicine) and hit "Print."
