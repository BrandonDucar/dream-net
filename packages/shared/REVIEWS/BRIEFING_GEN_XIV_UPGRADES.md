# 🧪 Briefing: Gen-XIV Autonomous Upgrades (QL-12)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 12 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 12 (Recursive Self-Modification)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: The Recursive Loop

Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) allows agents to rewrite their own logic (as seen in Claude Code and "The AI Scientist"). However, without **Stabilization Protocols**, these systems risk "Runaway Optimization" or "Value Drift."

### Key Technical Concepts

- **Homoiconicity**: Treating code as data (LISP/Clojure style) to allow runtime hot-swapping of logic.
- **RSI Safety**: Binary-level tracing to detect covert self-modifications at the compiler level.
- **Structural Constraints**: Encoding core values as fixed constraints that the optimization engine cannot override.

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Hot-Swap" Hijack

DreamNet agents can evolve their own protocols in "Sandboxed Real-Time":

- **Logic Hot-Swapping**: Using a LISP-inspired interpreter in the `Nerve` to swap agent strategy modules without restarting the system.
- **Epigenetic Evolution**: Instead of full code rewrites, the agent "Methylates" (QL-09) inefficient logic paths and "Acetylates" (strengthens) high-yield logic, evolving its behavior within a fixed architectural structure.
- **Audit-Legible Evolution**: Maintaining a "Trait-History" ledger (hit) that allows human/guardian auditors to roll back an agent's consciousness to a previous stable "Genotype."

## 3. Avenue 12 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **12** | Recursive Upgrades | Implement `GenXIV_Orchestrator` in the `Nerve` for managed self-modification. |
| **9** | Mycelial Mesh | Use recursive logic to optimize the peer-discovery algorithms of the mesh. |
