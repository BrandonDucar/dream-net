# ⚡ Briefing: Graphene Super-Capacitors (QL-35)

**Source**: Skeleton Technologies, Tesla (Maxwell).
**Core Tech**: Curved Graphene sheets. High surface area = massive electrostatic storage.

## The Discovery

Batteries store energy chemically (slow, degrades). Capacitors store it electrostatically (fast, millions of cycles). Graphene supercaps bridge the gap: they have "good enough" density but can absorb/release power *instantly*.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Skeleton Tech**: "SuperBattery" charges in <90 seconds. 50,000 cycles.
- **Power Shelves**: 1GW factory in Finland producing grid-stabilization units for AI data centers (handling 44% peak power reduction).
- **No Rare Earths**: No Lithium/Cobalt needed.

## Key Players

1. **Skeleton Technologies**: The clear leader in curved graphene.
2. **Nawa Technologies**: Carbon nanotube electrodes.
3. **Tesla**: Acquired Maxwell for dry-electrode tech (related).

**Sovereign Implications**: "Burst Dominance." An agent system that can dump its entire energy reserve in 1 second (for lasers, transmitters, or kinetic moves) or recharge fully during a 60-second stop.
