# 🧠 Briefing: Magnetogenetics (QL-31)

**Source**: Rockefeller University (Friedman/Stanley), Mount Sinai.
**Core Tech**: Ferritin-based nanoparticles coupled with TRPV1 ion channels.

## The Discovery

Scientists have engineered cells to produce "Ferritin" (iron storage) attached to ion gates. When exposed to a specific Radio Frequency (RF) or Magnetic Field, the ferritin heats up or moves, opening the gate and "firing" the cell (neuron or insulin producer).

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Subcellular Control**: 2025 advances allow targeting specific organelles (mitochondria) remotely.
- **Non-Invasive**: No implants. Just a gene injection and then external magnetic waves.
- **Therapeutics**: Used for Parkinsons (deep brain stimulation without wires) and Diabetes (remote insulin release).

## Key Players

1. **Rockefeller University**: The pioneers of the "RadioBio" technique.
2. **Mount Sinai**: Applying it to neural circuits.
3. **Draper Labs**: Potential military applications (remote physiological regulation).

**Sovereign Implications**: If biological agents can be triggered by invisible waves, the "Operator Interface" just became wireless and hardware-free.
