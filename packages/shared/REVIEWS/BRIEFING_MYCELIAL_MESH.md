# 🍄 Briefing: Mycelial Mesh Scaling (QL-05)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 5 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 9 (Elastic Network Expansion)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: The Gossip Economy

Standard client-server architectures are points of failure. True "Sovereignty" requires a peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh where intelligence propagates like pheromones.

### Key Player Profiles

- **libp2p (Gossipsub)**: The industry standard for high-bandwidth, high-frequency P2P messaging. It maintains an overlay mesh and uses "gossip" for metadata, ensuring sub-second state propagation across millions of nodes.
- **Kademlia DHT**: Used by BitTorrent and IPFS. It allows agents to discover each other and shared state without a central registry, even behind NATs or firewalls.

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Agentic Swarm"

DreamNet can surpass static node deployments by implementing **Elastic Mycelial Routing**:

- **Gossip Intensity Tuning**: Dynamic adjustment of the Gossipsub amplification factor based on metabolic priority (Avenue 12). Financial events get "Floodsub" priority; ambient sensing gets "Gossip" efficiency.
- **DHT as Memory Mirror**: Using the Kademlia DHT as a distributed secondary cache for the "Mammal Layer." Data is sharded across the swarm, making it impossible to kill a specific memory without destroying the entire network.

## 3. Avenue 9 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **9** | Mycelial Mesh Scaling | Implement an "Elastic Pulse" protocol where nodes can scale in/out based on the Schumann Resonance baseline (QL-03). |
| **19** | Seed Propagation | Use the BitTorrent "Seed" logic to distribute encrypted `memory-dna` shards to new agents automatically. |
