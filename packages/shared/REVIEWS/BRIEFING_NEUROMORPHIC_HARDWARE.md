# 🧠 Briefing: Neuromorphic Hardware (QL-34)

**Source**: Intel (Loihi), IBM (NorthPole), Prophesee.
**Core Tech**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in silicon. Event-driven processing.

## The Discovery

Traditional chips (CPU/GPU) process everything every clock cycle. Brains only fire when something changes ("Spikes"). Neuromorphic chips mimic this, achieving 1000x better energy efficiency and microsecond latency.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Intel Loihi 3**: 8 million neurons, 1.2 Watts. Designed for edge robotics.
- **IBM NorthPole**: 25x more efficient than H100s for inference.
- **Event Cameras**: Sensors that only record movement pixels (Prophesee), perfect pairs for these chips.

## Key Players

1. **Intel**: The research leader (Loihi).
2. **IBM**: The integration leader (TrueNorth/NorthPole).
3. **BrainChip**: Commercial edge AI (Akida).

**Sovereign Implications**: "Intelligence at the Edge." We can put high-IQ agents into tiny, battery-powered devices (sensors, bugs, wearables) that run for months.
