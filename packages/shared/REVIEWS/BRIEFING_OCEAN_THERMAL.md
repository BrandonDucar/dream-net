# 🌊 Briefing: Ocean Thermal Energy (QL-37)

**Source**: Makai Ocean Engineering, Lockheed Martin, Global OTEC.
**Core Tech**: Using the temperature difference between warm surface water and cold deep water to run a turbine.

## The Discovery

The ocean is a massive solar battery. The surface is hot (25°C), the deep is cold (4°C). This gradient can drive a closed-cycle ammonia turbine 24/7/365. It is the *only* renewable baseload.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Makai/Global OTEC**: Deploying a 1.5MW "Dominique" platform off Sao Tome (2026).
- **Cost**: High CAPEX, but near-zero OPEX.
- **Byproducts**: Desalinated water + Nutrient-rich cold water for aquaculture.

## Key Players

1. **Makai**: The engineering leaders (Hawaii).
2. **Global OTEC**: The commercializers (UK/Sao Tome).
3. **Lockheed Martin**: The defense contractor scaling it up.

**Sovereign Implications**: "The Atlantis Server." A floating data center in international waters that generates its own power, cools its own chips (using deep water), and answers to no jurisdiction.
