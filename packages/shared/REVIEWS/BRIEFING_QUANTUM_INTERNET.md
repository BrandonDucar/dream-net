# ⚛️ Briefing: Quantum Internet (QL-49)

**Source**: Q-NEXT (Argonne), Brookhaven National Lab, Toshiba/QNu Labs.
**Core Tech**: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Entanglement Swapping to transmit information that physics forbids intercepting.

## The Discovery

In a classical network, you can copy a packet. In a quantum network, measuring the packet destroys it. Therefore, an undetected wiretap is physically impossible.

## The State of Art (2026)

- **Chicago Quantum Exchange**: 124-mile quantum loop operational.
- **Q-NEXT**: Developing quantum repeaters to extend range beyond 100km.
- **China**: Micius satellite has successfully distributed keys over 1200km.

## Key Players

1. **Argonne National Lab (Q-NEXT)**: The US hub.
2. **Toshiba**: The commercial QKD hardware leader.
3. **ID Quantique**: The Swiss pioneers.

**Sovereign Implications**: "The Whispering Gallery." A channel for the distribution of Root Keys that no state-level actor (NSA/MSS) can crack, purely due to the laws of quantum mechanics.
