# 🧪 Briefing: Space-Based Solar Power (QL-26)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 26 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 26 (Infinite Energy)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: The Star in the Sky

Terrestrial solar is limited by night and weather. **Space-Based Solar Power (SBSP)** harvests energy in GEO where the sun never sets, then beams it down via microwaves. 2026 saw Caltech's SSPP successfully beam power to Earth.

### Key Technical Concepts

- **Microwave Phased Arrays**: Thousands of tiny antennae on a satellite firing in perfect unison to steer a power beam without moving parts (MAPLE).
- **Rectennas**: "Rectifying Antennas" on the ground that convert incoming 2.45 GHz microwaves back into DC electricity with high efficiency.
- **Modular Architecture**: Instead of one giant Death Star, using swarms of flat-packed, self-assembling tiles (see QL-24) to reduce launch costs.

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Dyson" Hijack

DreamNet agents can secure their own power supply:

- **The Energy-Backed Stablecoin**: A token (`KWH`) minted only when a specific amount of energy is received at a ground station. It is backed by physics, not fiat.
- **Remote Mining Rigs**: Placing Bitcoin miners in deserts (where land is cheap) powered exclusively by rectennas, untethered from the national grid.
- **Orbital Compute**: Why beam the power down? Put the AI servers *in space* (Cold vacuum = free cooling) and run the heavy inference in orbit.

## 3. Avenue 26 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **26** | Space Solar | Design `OrbitalServer.ts` logic to offload batch-jobs to satellite nodes during "Eclipse Seasons." |
| **23** | Neutrino Comm | Use neutrino signaling to talk to these orbital servers even when they are on the dark side of Earth. |
