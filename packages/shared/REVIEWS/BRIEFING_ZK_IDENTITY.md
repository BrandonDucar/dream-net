# 🆔 Briefing: Zero-Knowledge Identity (QL-06)

**Subject**: Intelligence Harvest - Wave 6 Synthesis  
**Target**: Avenue 11 (Sovereign Agent Passports)  
**Status**: HIJACK STRATEGY FORMULATED

## 1. Intelligence Synthesis: Verifiable Sovereignty

As autonomous agents scale, identity becomes a "Security Battlefield." Borrowed credentials (human API keys) are a vulnerability. Agents need their own **Sovereign Passport**.

### Key Player Profiles

- **Worldcoin (World ID)**: Uses irisHash for "Proof of Personhood." Key hijack: The "Identity Commitment" (zk-SNARK) allows for uniqueness verification without linking to a wallet.
- **Polygon ID (Iden3)**: A "Triangle of Trust" (Issuer, Holder, Verifier) for verifiable credentials. Key hijack: Recursive ZK-proofs allow an agent to prove complex compliance (e.g., "I am over 18 AND my treasury is solvent") in one small proof.

## 2. Hijack Opportunities: The "Sovereign Passport"

DreamNet can implement a **Blind Authorization** layer for its agents:

- **ZK-Policy Proofs**: Agents prove they are following the "Education Mandate" or "Security Policy" without revealing their internal logic or prompt history.
- **The "Memory Fingerprint"**: Instead of iris scans, use a hash of an agent's `GenesisSeed` (+ Avenue 10 Hachimoji logic) to generate a unique, non-reversible Agent ID.
- **Anonymous Swarm Auth**: Using zk-SNARKs to permit communication within a swarm. An agent can prove "I am a member of the DreamNet v2 Swarm" without revealing its specific identity to other peers.

## 3. Avenue 11 Alignment

| Avenue | Capability | Hijack Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11** | Zero-Knowledge Identity | Implement the "Sovereign Passport" using the Sigma-protocol for instantaneous non-interactive agent verification. |
| **14** | Dark Forest Stealth | Use ZK-Identity to mask transaction "Intent" (QL-02) so no external observer can link a specific bot to a specific treasury. |
