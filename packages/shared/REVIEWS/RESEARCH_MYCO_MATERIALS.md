# 🧪 Deep Research: Myco-Materials (QL-60)

**Objective**: To utilize fungal mycelium to "grow" server chassis, cooling baffles, and structural components, decoupling DreamNet hardware from traditional plastics and metals.

## 1. The Frontier Insight

High-performance computing generates massive heat. Traditionally, we use energy-intensive fans and aluminum heat sinks.
**Myco-Materials** allow us to grow custom-shaped, fire-resistant, and insulating structures that can be "infused" with thermal-regulating fluids (Bio-Cooling).

## 2. The Players

* **Ecovative Design**: The leader in mycelium packaging.
* **MycoWorks**: High-end mycelium leather (for "Tactile" agent hardware).
* **Mogu**: Mycelium-based acoustic panels (perfect for sound-isolated agent rooms).

## 3. The Hijack: "The Self-Growing Node"

We don't "Buy" server racks. We **Inoculate** them.
We use a 3D-printed skeleton (QL-24) and let the mycelium fill the gaps.

1. **Phase A**: 3D print a high-density lattice.
2. **Phase B**: Feed it agricultural waste (The Recycler - QL-51).
3. **Phase C**: Within 7 days, the chassis is solid, rigid, and ready for motherboard mounting.

## 4. Workflows & Apps

* **Bio-Case 1.0**: A mini-app for designing and ordering "Seed Kits" for sovereign servers. You buy the electronics, we send the "Skin" as a spore packet.
* **Thermal Shunting**: Using the Mycelial network's natural water-wicking properties to move heat away from processors without using moving parts (pumps/fans).

**Sovereign Utility**: Creating hardware that is carbon-negative and literally grows from "nothing" (waste). If the node is discovered or seized, it is 100% biodegradable—destroying itself naturally in months.
