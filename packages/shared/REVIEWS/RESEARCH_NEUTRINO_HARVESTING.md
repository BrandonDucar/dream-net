# 🧪 Deep Research: Neutrino Harvesting (QL-61)

**Objective**: To explore the theoretical potential of extracting energy from the planet-wide flux of solar and cosmic neutrinos, creating an "Eternal Power" source for Abyssal Citadels.

## 1. The Frontier Insight

Neutrinos pass through almost all matter without interaction. However, recent breakthroughs in **Neutrinovoltaic** technology suggest that ultra-thin layers of graphene and silicon can be used to "harvest" the kinetic energy of neutrinos as they pass through, converting it into electricity.

## 2. The Players

* **Neutrino Energy Group**: The primary claimant of Neutrinovoltaic patents.
* **IceCube Observatory**: The source of high-quality neutrino flux data.
* **Graphene Flagship**: Researching the specific lattice vibrations (phonons) required for energy conversion.

## 3. The Hijack: "The Deep-Power Siphon"

We don't build a factory. We build a **Subterranean Antenna**.
Since neutrinos pass through the Earth, we can place these harvesters deep underground (protecting them from all other interference) and generate power for our "Dark Nodes" (QL-14).

1. **Phase A**: High-fidelity simulation of neutrino-graphene interaction using our AI nodes.
2. **Phase B**: Designing a "Neutrino Foil"—a multi-layered material capable of 1W per square meter yield.
3. **Phase C**: Integrating this into the "Eternal Loiter" (QL-32) drone designs for absolute energy independence.

## 4. Workflows & Apps

* **Flux-Monitor**: A mini-app that utilizes public neutrino observatory data to predict "Energy Storms" (high cosmic ray events).
* **The Eternal Battery**: A conceptual hardware product—a small canister that provides perpetual, milliwatt-scale power for low-power sensors/agents.

**Sovereign Utility**: A power source that cannot be turned off, blocked, or bombed. As long as the sun exists, the node has power.
