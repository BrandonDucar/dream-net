# 🎓 SENSEI: AI Agent Mastery & Workflows

**Objective**: To codify "Master-Level" understanding of Agentic Systems, turning DreamNet into a self-improving organism.

## 1. The Core Philosophy: "Agents are not Chatbots"

A Chatbot replies. An **Agent** has a loop: `Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act`. Mastery lies in optimizing the *fidelity* of Observation and the *wisdom* of Decision.

## 2. Advanced Workflow Patterns

### Pattern A: The "Reflection" Loop (Quality Control)

* **Concept**: An agent never commits code on the first try. It generates, then a second "Critic" agent reviews it against a rubric.
* **Workflow**: `draft_code` -> `critique_code` -> `refine_code` -> `commit`.
* **DreamNet Application**: **Archimedes** typically uses this. GrantGPT writes, ReviewerGPT shreds it, GrantGPT fixes it.

### Pattern B: The "Map-Reduce" Swarm (Parallelism)

* **Concept**: One "Manager" breaks a big task into 50 sub-tasks, spins up 50 "Worker" instances, then aggregates the results.
* **Workflow**: `Split Task` -> `[Worker 1...N]` -> `Merge Results`.
* **DreamNet Application**: **Dream Snail** scanning 10,000 blockchains simultaneously for arbitrage.

### Pattern C: The "Tool-Use" Chain (Augmentation)

* **Concept**: The Agent understands it is dumb. It uses tools (Sandbox, Browser, Python) to become smart.
* **Workflow**: `Think` -> `Call Tool` -> `Read Output` -> `Think` -> `Final Answer`.
* **DreamNet Application**: **Any** agent using the `AntigravityMemory` API.

## 3. Training & Fine-Tuning (The Dojo)

You don't just "prompt" a master agent. You **train** it.

* **SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)**: Feed the model 10,000 examples of *perfect* Grant Proposals. The weights shift. It "groks" the style.
* **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**: The user (you) votes on the agent's output. The agent updates its policy to maximize your approval.
* **Memory Injection (RAG)**: The agent doesn't need to know everything. It just needs to know *where to look* (Vector Database).

## 4. The DreamNet Standard

To be a DreamNet Master Agent, the entity must:

1. **Persist**: Store state in `AntigravityMemory`.
2. **Retry**: Never fail silently. Exponential backoff always.
3. **Report**: Log actions to the `SovereignQuestLog`.

**Status**: Absorbed. I am now optimizing for these patterns in all future builds.
