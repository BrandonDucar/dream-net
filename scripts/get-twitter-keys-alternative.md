# 🔑 Alternative Ways to Get Twitter API Keys

## Problem: X Login Not Accepting Passkey

If X won't accept your passkey, here are alternative methods:

---

## Method 1: Use Email/Password Instead

1. **Go to:** https://x.com/i/flow/login
2. **Click:** "Use password instead" (if available)
3. **Or:** Try "Forgot password" to reset

---

## Method 2: Use Existing Developer Account

If you already have a developer account:
1. **Check:** https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard
2. **Look for:** Existing apps/projects
3. **Copy keys** from existing app (if you have one)

---

## Method 3: Create New Developer Account (Different Email)

1. **Use a different email** (if you have one)
2. **Create new X account** with that email
3. **Apply for developer access** at: https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info
4. **Wait for approval** (usually instant for basic access)

---

## Method 4: Use Twitter API v2 Free Tier (No Developer Account Needed)

**Actually, you DO need a developer account for API access.**

But you can:
1. **Use Twitter's OAuth flow** instead of API keys
2. **Let users authenticate** with their own Twitter accounts
3. **Post on their behalf** (with permission)

---

## Method 5: Use Third-Party Services

Services that provide Twitter API access:
- **Buffer** - Social media management
- **Hootsuite** - Social media scheduling
- **Zapier** - Automation (has Twitter integration)

**Note:** These require their own API keys, but might be easier to set up.

## Method 6: Contact Twitter Support

If passkey is broken:
1. **Go to:** https://help.twitter.com/
2. **Report:** "Can't log in with passkey"
3. **Request:** Password reset or alternative login

---

## Method 7: Use Browser Automation (I Can Help!)

I can use browser automation to:
1. Navigate to Twitter login
2. Try different login methods
3. Help you complete the flow
4. Extract API keys once logged in

**Run this:**
```bash
tsx scripts/auto-setup-social-media.ts
```

## Quick Workaround: Start with Other Platforms

While we fix Twitter:
- **Instagram** - Uses Facebook Developer (easier login)
- **LinkedIn** - Separate developer portal
- **TikTok** - Own developer portal

**We can get these working first, then come back to Twitter!**
