# Landing Page Redesign - Anti-Corporate

## Current State
- Has good structure but feels corporate
- Standard hero section
- Boring buttons ("Get Started", "Learn More")
- Too clean, too safe

## New Vision: Break the Mold

### Hero Section Redesign

**Current**: "DreamNet orchestrates a living network..."
**New**: Bold, creative, anti-corporate statement

**Ideas**:
- "We're not Base. We're not corporate. We're DreamNet."
- "Dreams don't fit in spreadsheets."
- "Built on Base, but we're not Base."
- Asymmetric layout, bold typography
- Animated background (particles, glitches)
- No stock photos, no corporate speak

### Visual Changes

1. **Typography**
   - Mix of bold sans-serif + monospace
   - Larger, more experimental
   - Gradient text effects
   - No boring Arial/Helvetica

2. **Layout**
   - Asymmetric, not centered
   - Overlapping elements
   - Creative use of negative space
   - Not grid-based (break the grid)

3. **Colors**
   - Keep electric cyan/magenta
   - Add more gradients
   - Glowing effects
   - Dark, cyberpunk aesthetic

4. **Buttons**
   - Not "Get Started" → "Enter the Dream"
   - Not "Learn More" → "See What's Possible"
   - Animated, glowing
   - Not flat/material design

5. **Content**
   - No corporate jargon
   - Creative, expressive language
   - Show personality
   - Be weird (in a good way)
