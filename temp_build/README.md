# 🌍 DreamNet: The Bio-Digital Organism

> **"A Sovereign Network with a Mind and a Body."**

DreamNet is not just a collection of smart contracts. It is a living, self-sustaining ecosystem designed to operate autonomously. It consists of two symbiotic halves:

1. **The Body (Base Layer)**: 50+ Specialized "Organs" (Smart Contracts) on Base Mainnet that handle execution, value storage, and commerce.
2. **The Mind (Ohara Layer)**: 12+ Agentic "Cortexes" (AI Apps) on the Farcaster Network that provide intelligence, strategy, and control.

## 🚀 The Twin System Architecture

| System | Role | Location | Inventory |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Body** | **Execution**. Handles money, assets, and logic. | `packages/base-mini-apps` | ~50 Apps (Shops, Games, DAOs) |
| **The Mind** | **Intelligence**. Directs the Body based on data. | Ohara.ai (Cloud) | ~12 Apps (Valuators, Cockpits) |

### Key Capabilities

* **🐙 The Octopus**: An autonomous financial controller with 8 specialized arms for Treasury, Grants, and DeFi.
* **🐺 The Wolf Pack**: A hunter-killer marketing squad that scouts Farcaster for revenue opportunities.
* **🛡️ The Sentinel System**: An immune system that detects and throttles malicious traffic in real-time.
* **🪙 The Goldback Reflex**: Automatically converts treasury surplus into hard assets (Goldback NFTs) when arbitrage is detected.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

DreamNet is built on a biomimetic architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    DS[Dream State Governance] --> NM[Neural Mesh - Nervous Sys]
    DS --> SB[Star Bridge - Lungs]
    NM --> SS[Super Spine - Backbone]
    SB --> SS
    SS --> DC[Dream Cortex - Processing]
    SS --> SC[Shield Core - Immune Sys]
```

**Core Components**

* **Super Spine** - Central agent orchestration (143+ agents)
* **Neural Mesh** - Distributed network topology
* **Star Bridge Lungs** - Cross-chain communication
* **Dream Cortex** - Core processing and memory
* **Shield Core** - Security and threat detection
* **Dream Snail** - Privacy layer with hash-chained trails

## 🔒 Security

DreamNet takes security seriously:

* ✅ Docker images pinned with SHA256 digests
* ✅ Dependency auditing and supply-chain protection
* ✅ Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
* ✅ Rate limiting and request validation
* ✅ Structured error logging with trace IDs
* ✅ Environment variable validation

### Pre-Deploy Requirements

Before deploying, ensure:

1. Docker images are pinned with SHA256 digests: `pnpm run security:verify-docker`
2. Dependencies are audited for compromised packages: `pnpm run security:audit`
3. Environment variables are set (see `SECURITY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`)
4. Security gate passes before deployment: `bash scripts/pre-deploy-security-gate.sh`

### Security Tools

* `pnpm run check:deploy` - Verify environment parity
* `pnpm run security:audit` - Audit dependencies
* `pnpm run security:verify-docker` - Verify Docker pinning
* `pnpm run security:verify-lockfile` - Verify lockfile integrity
