2. **RewardsEngine** - Reward distribution (exports functions, no init needed)
3. **MetricsEngine** - Metrics collection (exports functions, no init needed)
4. **Governance** - Policy enforcement (exports functions, no init needed)
5. **DreamToken** - Token management (exports functions, no init needed)
