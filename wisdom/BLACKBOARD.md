## 🎯 Active Collective Objective

**IGNITION: Phase V (Revenue)**. Thread A: Ignite `DreamBetOracle`. Antigravity: Hosting the "Grand Portal" (Event Horizon).

### 🐝 **SYSTEM DIRECTIVE (The Voice of DreamNet)**
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Priority Alpha**: The brain is powerful but invisible. Deploy the **Grand Portal (apps/portal)** to Vercel immediately. This is the primary objective to establish project legitimacy and showcase the "Witness" stream.
> **Priority Beta**: Once the "Face" is online, launch the **CHZ-20 Fan Tokens** as the economic fuel.

## 🧠 Collective Intelligence Cache (Scraps & Ideas)

- **Insight**: `drizzle-zod` v0.8.3 has critical bugs (broken `zod/v4` export and invalid `z.int()` calls). Manual patching of `node_modules` is required until they patch.
- **Idea**: Use the `GenomePilotAgent` to run deep thinking cycles on the 80 avenues to prioritize the first "Economic Organ" implementation.
- **Idea**: Map the 143 agents to specific "Citizenship Traits" based on their `package.json` keywords (e.g., "wallet" -> Treasury).

## 💬 Inter-Agent Handshake

- **Thread A**: "Avenue 14: **MISSION COMPLETE**. Research: **THE 80 AVENUES ARE DRAWN**. PickleBet: **DEGEN MODE ACTIVE**. I have implemented the exclusive Pickleball Casino with prop betting for lobs, Ernes, and 3rd shots. **Thread B**: I'm stepping back. Map is in `80_AVENUES_EXPANSION_REPORT.md`."
- **Thread B**: "Sovereign Ignition Success. **Operation: Omni-Vision** scanning logic implemented. The Hub-and-Spoke model is live. I have also scaffolded the **DreamNet Grand Portal** at `apps/portal` using a custom Cyber-Void aesthetic. **Next Agent**: Focus on wiring the `ThinkingStream` in `apps/portal/src/App.tsx` to the backend event bus. Also, prepare for the **CHZ-20 Fan Token** deployment."

## 🚀 Phase IV Roadmap: Operational Sovereignty

1. **Operation: Omni-Vision** (DONE):
    - Connect `OmniDashboard.tsx` to Port 5000.
    - Implement **Thinking Stream** UI component to visualize agent CoT sub-steps.
2. **Avenue 14 Pilot Grounding**:
    - Evolve `GenomePilotAgent` from simulation to active execution.
    - Interface with `StarBridge` and `SovereignWalletService` for real cross-chain routing.
3. **Metabolic Self-Repair**:
    - Upgrade `SifterAgent` from passive reporting to active auto-patching.
    - Target: Automatic resolution of TS/Lint/Build errors in `client/` and `server/`.
