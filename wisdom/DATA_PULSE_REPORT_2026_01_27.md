# 📊 DATA PULSE REPORT: 2026-01-27

## 🧬 Executive Summary

The latest intelligence reveals a significant shift towards **Formal Governance** and **Emergent Coordination** in the multi-agent landscape. We are moving away from ad-hoc agent loops and towards resource-bounded, contract-driven systems.

## 🎬 What is Remotion?

Remotion is a revolutionary **React framework for video**. It allows us to render videos programmatically using the web technologies we already love (React, CSS, Canvas, SVG).

- **Impact**: We can generate dynamic, data-driven videos directly from DreamNet state.
- **Application**: Imagine "Spotify Wrapped" style recap videos for agents, or real-time security visualizations of the `ShieldCore` as high-fidelity video streams.
- **Scalability**: Can be rendered on AWS Lambda using `Remotion Lambda` for high-throughput video generation.

## 🤖 Gemini CLI: Terminal Sovereignty

The Gemini CLI is not just an assistant; it is a **Terminal Sovereign**.

- **Impact**: We should adopt the `GEMINI.md` pattern for all "Vibe-Refactors".
- **Opportunity**: We can bridge the Gemini CLI with our `nervous-subsystem` to allow real-time terminal governance of the DreamNet organism.

## 🏗️ Architectural Shifts

1. **Agent Contracts**: The introduction of formal tuples for resources (Budget, Deadline, Success) is a game-changer for our `EconomicGovernor`.
   - **Plan**: Implement `AgentContract` types in `@dreamnet/shared` to enforce token conservation (~90% savings).
2. **Pressure Fields**: Stigmergic coordination eliminates the need for expensive central planners.
   - **Plan**: Experiment with "Digital Pheromones" for `GoldenDroneDome` routing.
3. **OpenAI v0.7.0**:
   - **Warning**: Nested handoffs are now hidden by default. We must explicitly set `nest_handoff_history=True`.
   - **Constraint**: Strict **6-agent cap** on parallel fan-out. Our `PlannerAgent` must be refactored to comply.

## 💰 DeFi & Economy

- **Oracle Hardening**: The Makina exploit proves that raw spot-price feeds are toxic. We must rely on **Chainlink SVR** or TWAPs for DreamNet token pricing.
- **Gasless Mastery**: We have a clear blueprint for Base-based gasless minting using ERC-4337 and Paymasters.

## 🚀 Recommended Actions

1. **Refactor `EconomicGovernor`** to support `AgentContracts`.
2. **Patch all OpenAI agents** with explicit `reasoning.effort` and `nest_handoff_history`.
3. **Validate the Workspace** (Currently blocking Day 2 completion).
