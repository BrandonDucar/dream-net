# Paper #1: The Self-Healing Nerve Bus 🧠⚡

**Abstract**:
The DreamNet Nerve Bus is a neuromorphic communication layer designed for high-frequency agentic interaction. By hijacking principles from HFT (High-Frequency Trading) and Chaos Theory, we achieve deterministic latency and edge-of-chaos stability in a decentralized swarm.

## 1. Deterministic Latency (The HFT Hijack)

We implement a "Zero-Copy" event routing mechanism that ensures pulses travel across the nervous system with < 1ms overhead. By pre-allocating memory for agent synapses, we eliminate GC pauses during critical "Alchemy Cycles."

## 2. Edge-of-Chaos Governance

DreamNet operates at the thermodynamic limit of chaos. We use an "Atmospheric Stability Governor" (Avenue 31) to prevent cascading failures. When a spike becomes incoherent, the governor injects a "Stability Pulse" to reset the agentic state without losing historical context.

## 3. Mycelial Resource Sharing

Inspired by advanced mycology (Avenue 06), agents do not compete for tokens; they share them via a "Nutrient Mesh." High-performing agents ("Fruiting Bodies") distribute excess intelligence to dormant agents via the nerve bus.

## 4. Neuromorphic Event Spiking

Unlike traditional REST APIs, the Nerve Bus uses temporal spiking. An agent only "fires" when a signal crosses a dynamic threshold, drastically reducing energy consumption and noise in the cloud-core.
